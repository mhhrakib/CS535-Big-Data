    "document": "Most of the Secret Service agents embroiled in a prostitution scandal brought women back to their Colombia hotel rooms before President Obama arrived in town for an international summit, Rep. Pete King said Saturday. King said the raunchy rendezvous involved 11 agents and went sour when an agent refused to pay one of the women, who were presumed to be hookers. \"The agent said, 'I do not owe you anything,' but gave the woman some money,\" said King R-L.I. ,the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, who was briefed on the matter. \"I do not know how much, and it was settled right there.\" IN COLOMBIA, THE SEX BUSINESS IS SO BIG THAT SOME CALL IT THE 'THAILAND OF LATIN AMERICA' As it turned out, the agents' troubles were just beginning. Local cops were called to the hotel in Cartagena and, because the matter involved foreigners, a report was written up and sent to the YOU.S. Embassy, King said. Embassy officials in turn notified the Secret Service, which immediately launched an investigation. At least one supervisor was among the agents involved, King said. He was not certain exactly how many women were involved. The scandal a black eye for the United States' reputation abroad was revealed Friday just hours before President Obama arrived in Cartagena. The 11 agents were part of an advance team assigned to secure a local hotel before the summit began, yet their attention apparently turned to taking advantage of Colombia's policy of legal prostitution. Five American service members were also accused of misconduct stemming from the scandalous incident at the hotel, according to the YOU.S. military. \"They had arranged to have a bunch of prostitutes come by and one of the agents refused to pay a prostitute,\" said author Ronald Kessler, one of the leading experts on the Secret Service. \"Yes, doubly good judgment there.\" Fernando Vergara AP Kessler, who was briefed on the investigation by his sources within the agency, told the Daily News Saturday that the spurned hooker told police about the lack of payment. The 11 agents were immediately recalled to Washington. \"Their careers are over,\" said Kessler. \"Number one, it is against basic ethics to go to a prostitute,\" he continued. \"Number two, it is incredibly embarrassing to the White House.\" \"And number three,\" he continued. \"It could leave them open to blackmail and a possible assassination attempt.\" Obama still has \"full confidence\" in the Secret Service, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney, who declared late Saturday that the incident \"has been more of a distraction for the press\" than the President. Kessler said two of the agents were supervisors who attempted to cover up the mortifying incident. The agents were staying at the beachfront Hotel Caribe, which is also hosting the White House staff and the traveling press team. Guests at the swanky hotel told reporters that several of the agents had been spotted drinking heavily during their weeklong stay. Details of the incident remain murky, but YOU.S. officials believe one agent took a woman back to his room Wednesday night and threw her out in a dispute over money. The woman caused a commotion in the hallway, getting the attention of local cops and other Secret Service agents, a senior official told The New York Times. Though it was not known if all 11 members of the Secret Service team are suspected of wrongdoing, they were all recalled as part of the investigation. Several of the agents are married, according to reports. Prostitution is legal in Colombia, as long as it is conducted in so-called \"tolerance zones.\" Though the exact boundaries of the zones frequently change and are rarely enforced by police, the coastal city of Cartagena is a popular destination for prostitution and sex tourism. Hookers can easily be procured online or in bars or hotels in much of the city. It was not clear how the agents met the women involved in the incident. The scandal threatened to overshadow President Obama's visit to the important summit. He landed in Cartagena Friday night and attended a formal dinner with the other world leaders at Castillo San Felipe de Barajasajas, an historic Spanish fortress. The President, who had a full day of summit events Saturday, has not addressed the Secret Service scandal. He is not staying at the Hotel Caribe. The Secret Service did not elaborate on the allegations Saturday. The night before, the agency which is charged with protecting the President simply confirmed that the officers were pulled back to Washington. All of the agents are based in Washington, D.C., according to Kessler, author of \"In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect.\" The matter was turned over to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles the Secret Services' internal affairs.

AP Photo Carolyn. Associated Press The controversy also expanded to the YOU.S. military, which announced five service members staying at the same hotel as the agents in Colombia may have been involved in misconduct as well. They were confined to their quarters in Colombia and ordered not to have contact with others. All the alleged activities took place before Obama arrived Friday in this Colombian port city for meetings with 33 other regional leaders. Put together, the allegations were an embarrassment for an American president on foreign soil and threatened to upend White House efforts to keep his trip focused squarely on boosting economic ties with fast-growing Latin America. Obama was holding two days of meetings at the Summit of the Americas with leaders from across the vast region before heading back to Washington Sunday night. The Secret Service did not disclose the nature of the misconduct. The Associated Press confirmed on Friday that it involved prostitutes. The White House said Obama had been briefed about the incidents but would not comment on his reaction. \"The president does have full confidence in the United States Secret Service,\" presidential spokesman Jay Carney said when asked. Carney insisted the matter was more a distraction for the media than Obama. But Secret Service assistant director Paul Morrissey said in a statement: \"We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused.\" Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the AP after he was briefed on the investigation on Saturday that \"close to\" all 11 of the agents involved had brought women back to their rooms at a hotel separate from where Obama is now staying. The New York Republican said the women were \"presumed to be prostitutes\" but investigators were interviewing the agents. The lawmaker also offered new details about the controversy. King said he was told that anyone visiting the hotel overnight was required to leave identification at the front desk and leave the hotel by 7 a.m. When a woman failed to do so, it raised questions among hotel staff and police, who investigated. They found the woman with the agent in the hotel room and a dispute arose over whether the agent should have paid her. King said he was told that the agent did eventually pay the woman. The incident was reported to the YOU.S. embassy, prompting further investigation, King said The 11 employees in question were special agents and Uniformed Division Officers. None were assigned to directly protect Obama. All were sent home and replaced, Morrissey said, given \"the nature of the allegations\" and a zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct. The Secret Service says the incidents have had no bearing on its ability to provide security for Obama's stay in Colombia. Another jolt came Saturday when the YOU.S. Southern Command said five service members assigned to support the Secret Service violated their curfew and may have been involved in inappropriate conduct. Carney said it was part of the same incident involving the Secret Service. As for the apparent misconduct by the military members, Gen. Douglas Fraser, commander of YOU.S. Southern Command, said he was \"disappointed by the entire incident\" and said the behavior was \"not in keeping with the professional standards expected of members of the United States military.\" Col. Scott Malcom, chief of public affairs for Southern Command, said of the five service members: \"The only misconduct I can confirm is that they were violating the curfew established. He said he had seen the news reports about the Secret Service agents involved in alleged prostitution at the hotel but could not confirm whether the service members also were involved. The military is investigating. The Secret Service agents at the center of the allegations had stayed at Cartagena's five-star Hotel Caribe. Several members of the White House staff and press corps subsequently stayed at the hotel. King credited the Secret Service director for acting quickly to remove the agents in question and replace them before Obama's arrival. A hotel employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, said the agents arrived at the beachfront hotel about a week ago and said the agents left the hotel Thursday, a day before Obama and other regional leaders arrived for the weekend summit. Three waiters interviewed by the AP at the hotel described the agents as drinking heavily during their stay. On Friday, the hotel began filling up with the delegations of some of the more than 30 countries whose leaders are convening for the weekend Summit of the Americas. The hotel's public relations director, Ana Beatriz Angel, refused to comment on the incident, which she said \"concerns only and exclusively the YOU.S. government.\" On the steamy streets of Cartagena, a resort city with a teeming prostitution trade, there was condemnation for the Secret Service agents for what residents saw as abusing their station and dishonoring their country. Edwin Yepes, a souvenir vendor, said \"they are supposed to come here and set an example. We are an inferior culture, and so it is better if they do not come than if they damage our image of them.\" _ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Ben Feller in Washington, Frank Bajak and Pedro Mendoza in Cartagena and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this story.",

    "document": "Perhaps Google Alphabet? should have googled its new name before it decided to restructure the whole company. The New York Times reports that Google's new parent company, Alphabet, has encountered an issue with german automaker BMW, which owns a fleet services company with the same name and the domain Alphabet.com. A spokesperson for BMW told the Times the company is not planning on selling its domain and that Alphabet was a large part of its business. See also: What Google has to gain by adopting the Alphabet With the major restructuring announcement yesterday, Alphabet launched abc.xyz as its domain name. Alphabet, led by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is now the parent company of Google, a move designed to separate the core products search, Gmail, Android, etc. from its more far reaching projects Fiber, Calico, X, self-driving cars While the move makes sense for Alphabet, it confused many. BMW is looking into whether Google's Alphabet has infringed on its trademark, with no legal action currently planned. Since the announcement, Alphabet.com has been down, likely due to the increased traffic it is undoubtedly receiving. Other companies also have the Alphabet name. Reuters notes that more than 100 companies have trademark registrations in the YOU.S. that incorporate the word alphabet in some capacity. For example, Alphabet, Inc. is an Ohio company founded in 1965 that manufactures electrical components for the auto industry, according to Bloomberg. Even the Alphabet Twitter handle already has an owner. It belongs to a man named Chris Andrikanich, who is probably receiving a bit more attention than he is used to. Well, that was an interesting way to end a Monday. Chris Andrikanich alphabet August 10, 2015 Y Combinator founder Paul Graham wrote a blog post saying it is an absolute must for companies to own the .com domain for their names just days before Google's announcement. While Graham says domains are not as important for finding a company's online presence as they used to be, not owning the .com domain \"signals weakness.\" This might not prove to be an issue for the new Alphabet, however. Google founder Page said Alphabet would not be introducing products under its own name, so it would not be a public facing name like Google. In any event, it is oddly comforting to know Google Alphabet has the same problem many do when they are trying to purchase a domain for their own website. <doc_sep> As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\" From the start, we have always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. more We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we have not stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We have long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant. Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President. What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens and Calico focused on longevity Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that are not very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We will also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we will determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole. This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said and sometimes better! for quite some time now, and I have been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation-continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world's information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth. Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure. Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG. For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google-the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alphabet Alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products-the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands. We are excited about. Getting more ambitious things done. Taking the long-term view. Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish. Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see. Improving the transparency and oversight of what we are doing. Making Google even better through greater focus. And hopefully. as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can. What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Do not worry, we are still getting used to the name too! <doc_sep> Google has bought the alphabet. Not literally of course if that is even possible but it has acquired the domain name abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, just a few days after Google officially became a subsidiary of Alphabet, its new holding company. The domain was created in 1999 and was updated on Wednesday when Google took control of it, according to domain database Whois. It is unclear how much it was bought for. Read More from CNBC: Why Investors Like Google's Alphabet News Google announced its restructuring in August in a bid to separate its core businesses such as search and Android from its \"moonshots\" like driverless cars. At the time, Google unveiled its website with a URL of abc.xyz.

Google owns 18,095 other domains, data on Whois shows. It is the owner of Googl.com and Gogle.com, so if people misspell Google, they will still be redirected to the search engine. Sometimes, companies will make defensive acquisitions of user names in order to prevent them being embarrassed in the future. The YOU.S. tech giant also owns the domain GoogleSucks.com. Read More from CNBC: Alphabet to Back Symphony Messaging Tool The change to Alphabet has caused Google some headaches when it comes to domain names. It does not actually own alphabet.com because it is currently owned by German carmaker BMW. A report in the New York Times earlier this year suggested that BMW does not want to sell it. The news was first reported by DomainInvesting.com.",
    "reference_summary": "Guess Google execs are serious about that whole reorg under the Alphabet parent-company thing. Just days after Alphabet officially became Google's holding company, it scooped up a brand-new domain name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, which has been around since 1999 and was purchased for an unspecified amount, NBC News reports. The page is not functional as of this post, and a company rep says, \"We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we are just being thorough.\" Google set up that website in August. It is hard to imagine Google directing the general public to use the site-would you want to type in all those letters every time?-and NBC notes the domain purchase may simply be a preemptive strike to keep others from usurping it for their own use. Two domains the company probably will not be able to get its hands on: ABC.com for the American Broadcasting Company, owned by Disney and alphabet.com, which BMW is unlikely to give up, notes Consumerist. If you would been hoping to nab the domain for yourself, you can always try to cybersquat the site away when Google's hold on it expires in August 2018. Alphabet has ditched its \"Do not Be Evil\" motto for one that is not as quirky.",

Jennifer Connell claims the boy, Sean Tarala of Westport, acted unreasonable when he leaped into her arms, causing her to fall on the ground and break her wrist four years ago. This week Connell is asking a six-member Superior Court jury to find the boy liable for his actions. She is seeking 127,000 from the boy, who she described as always being \"very loving, sensitive,\" toward her. The boy is the only defendant in the case. In court Friday, the boy, now 12 years old, appeared confused as he sat with his father, Michael Tarala, in the Main Street courtroom. The boy's mother, Lisa Tarala, died last year. On the witness stand before Judge Edward Stodolink, the 54-year-old Connell, a human resources manager in Manhattan, testified she loves Sean but believes he should be held accountable for her injury. On March 18, 2011, Connell, who has no children of her own, arrived at the Tarala home at 25 Woods Grove Road to attend Sean's birthday party. The boy had gotten his first two-wheeler for his birthday, and was joyfully riding the bright-red bike around and around the home, according to testimony. But when he spotted Connell, he dropped the new bicycle on the ground, exclaiming, \"Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen.\" \"All of a sudden he was there in the air, I had to catch him and we tumbled onto the ground,\" Connell testified of her encounter with the 50-pound boy. \"I remember him shouting, 'Auntie Jen I love you,' and there he was flying at me.\" Although hurt, Connell said, she did not complain to the boy at the time. \"It was his birthday party and I did not want to upset him,\" she told the jury. But, Connell continued, her life was turned upside down as a result of the injury. \"I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walk-up so it has been very difficult,\" she said. \"And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.\" And then there is the damage the injury has done to Connell's social life. \"I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate,\" she said. \"The injuries, losses and harms to the plaintiff were caused by the negligence and carelessness of the minor defendant in that a reasonable eight years old under those circumstances would know or should have known that a forceful greeting such as the one delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff could cause the harms and losses suffered by the plaintiff,\" the lawsuit claims.",

The New York City woman, who is suing Sean for 127,000, testified in court Friday that when she arrived at her nephew's birthday party in Westport, Conn., on March 28, 2011, Sean was riding his brand-new bike outside. When he saw Connell, she said, he ran toward her yelling, \"Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen!\" and then flung his 50-pound body at her, knocking them both to the ground and breaking her wrist. \"I remember him shouting, 'Auntie Jen, I love you,' and there he was flying at me,\" she testified. Connell told the jury she did not complain about her injury at the time because \"it was his birthday party and I did not want to upset him,\" but she noted that the broken wrist upended her busy life. \"I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walk-up, so it has been very difficult,\" she said. \"And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.\" Not to mention how it affected her in social situations: \"I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate,\" she noted. Even though Connell says Sean-who the Post notes listened with his dad to his aunt's testimony looking \"confused\"; his mom died last year-has always been \"very loving\" and \"sensitive\" toward her, she thinks he should still be liable and understand that his actions have consequences.

Founded by law enforcement officials with over 60 years of experience, MyMatchChecker was created to help protect online daters from the multitude of scammers, identity thieves, sexual predators, felons and even worse. Wherever you are in your relationship, you should do a background check. <doc_sep> Advertisement Continue reading the main story Never mind whether your date is smart or good-looking. How do you know you are not flirting with a felon? For a small fee, a nascent crop of companies wants to help you find out by running background checks on the potential flames you encounter on Match.com, eHarmony or any of the nation's nearly 1,500 dating Web sites. At the same time, at least two states, New York and New Jersey, have begun regulating Internet dating sites, and legal experts say they believe changes to the liability laws that protect such sites are on the horizon. And you thought your mother was the only one who wanted to vet your love life. The focus on background screenings comes as some 20 million Americans are using dating sites, more than double the number five years ago, according to the market research firm IBISWorld. While they are finding casual dates and even love, they are also encountering married people pretending to be single or, worse, sexual predators and convicted felons. No one has put a number on how much violence stems from dating sites, according to groups that keep track of rape and other violent crimes, like the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Victims of Crime. Yet plenty of crime stories begin with two people skimming each other's online dating profiles. Consider the widely reported case of Jeffrey Marsalis, a serial rapist in Philadelphia who met his victims on Match.com. Such perils have been around since the dawn of the Internet, an ideal medium for complex cover-ups. But now that online dating is a billion-dollar industry, state officials, public safety advocates and enterprising businesses are calling for further safeguards. Whether it is possible, however, to effectively screen people and make sites more truthful is unclear. After all, members are not always honest about their age and weight. \"What we want to do is provide some degree of safety,\" said Robert Buchholz, a retired New York State Police captain who, with Andrew J. Scott, a former police chief in Boca Raton, Fla., founded MyMatchChecker.com, a Web site that went live in April, enabling people to request background checks on anyone they have met on a dating site. Mr. Buchholz and Mr. Scott, who each have more than 30 years of law enforcement experience, said that having daughters inspired them to try to make online dating safer. Their company offers a basic background search for 9.95. In addition to Web sites, a flurry of mobile phone apps aim to make background checks as quick and easy as ordering a pizza: Just plug in a couple of facts like a name and birth date. ValiMate, the creator of the Instant National Criminal Search app, even allows users to send the results of the check to a friend for added safety. Date Check, from Intelius, encourages users to \"look up before you hook up.\" The app is marketed to women who want to perform a background check on would-be Romeos \"in the time it takes to redo your lip gloss.\" Industry professionals say that predators are usually men. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story State officials are also pushing for safer Internet dating. A law that takes effect this month in New York State, the Internet Dating Safety Act, requires sites to post common-sense safety tips, like \"meet in a public place.\" Assemblywoman Audrey I. Pheffer, a sponsor of the Internet law, said that it grew out of her realization that online dating had become ubiquitous, even among people she \"never dreamed\" would pursue romance online. Some states have considered similar legislation but ultimately rejected it. New York's law is like one passed in 2008 by New Jersey, which also requires dating sites with a membership fee to inform users whether they do criminal background checks most do not Such legislation was championed by True.com, one of the first major online dating companies to screen members to determine if they are married, felons or sexual offenders about 2 percent of those who try to sign up are rejected, they said Ruben Buell, the company's president, said that the type of checks it conducted were inexpensive. \"You are talking pennies per check.\" Still, most online dating companies question whether such checks can be effective. They contend that because state and county databases are incomplete, the checks give daters a false sense of security. Even advocates of criminal screenings concede that they are imperfect because the databases vary in quality and availability. Some counties, for instance, do not keep digital records. Others do not provide data about sex offenders. \"If I really knew that there was great ability for us to not let anyone on the site that should not be on the site, I would do it,\" said Mandy Ginsberg, the general manager and executive vice president of Match.com. Background checks, she said, might lead daters to think everyone they encounter on the sites is safe. Ms. Pheffer said she originally wanted background checks but decided against them for the same reason. Critics also point out that companies that conduct background screenings are not necessarily perfect. Some have mishandled information. Another concern involves mobile apps, which can provide personal information to people who may abuse it. Braden Cox, a policy counsel for NetChoice, a group that advocates for Internet companies, said that background screenings were well intentioned but that most could be thwarted. \"Most people, thankfully, are good people on these Web sites,\" said Mr. Cox, who speaks from experience: a few weeks ago he married a woman he met on Match.com. Dating sites have no incentive to police their members. The Communications Decency Act absolves Internet service providers of liability because the sites are not considered the publishers of the information on their pages their members are. The reasoning is that sites would not be able to operate if they were responsible for everything posted by their users. Lawyers have tried to get around this law, but \"they usually fail,\" said Brian Carver, an assistant professor at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Every start-up depends on this protection.\" Parry Aftab, a lawyer and safety expert, says she is increasingly hearing about alarming cases involving online dating, like pedophiles who woo single mothers to get near their children. She expects there will be challenges to that immunity if sites accept money from members and have knowledge of criminal behavior. Meanwhile, she advises singles to be cautious. \"Do not give up your heart so fast,\" she said.",

New York and New Jersey are the first two states to offer some regulations on Internet dating sites, such as requiring sites to post safety tips and to say whether they require background checks of their members. Experts say that many more states will soon follow. Although some sites like True.com insist on background checks for all members, other dating sites say this is a false sense of security because criminal screening databases are imperfect.

    "document": "David Frederick, center, outside counsel with Aereo Inc., speaks to the media with Chief Executive Chet Kanojia, left, and General Counsel Brenda Cotter after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the broadcasters' copyright-infringement lawsuit against Aereo. Andrew Harrer Bloomberg If you are comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments in ABC vs. Aereo should change your mind. Admittedly, the case is about copyrights, not circuitry. In particular, the issue focuses on whether Aereo's service violates broadcasters' exclusive rights to transmit works to the public. Yet the inner workings of Aereo's system are crucial to that issue, at least from Aereo's point of view. And the justices struggled to get past a simplistic view of the technology involved. For example, at one point Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that unlike a rooftop TV antenna, the tiny antennas that Aereo sets up in a city could \"pick up every television signal in the world and send it into a person's computer.\" That is physically impossible, not just because antennas are not sensitive enough to detect signals from outside the local market but because the world is not, you know, flat. \"And that sounds so much like what a cable TV system does or what a satellite system does,\" Breyer continued, \"that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that is imposed upon them. That is what disturbs everyone on the court Everyone outside the court should be disturbed by a question like that. At stake here is the degree to which innovative companies are going to have to seek permission from copyright owners to enable people to do in the cloud what they can do for themselves at home. Aereo uses its tiny antennas and circuitry to let people tune in, record and stream local TV programs over the Internet. Because each antenna, recording and stream is initiated and controlled by individual users, Aereo says the online transmissions are not public performances, they are private ones. The networks counter that if Aereo can do that without obtaining licenses, other pay-TV operators will follow suit, destroying an important revenue stream and pressuring them to abandon free over-the-air broadcasting. Justice Sonia Sotomayor opened the session by asking the broadcasters' attorney, veteran Supreme Court litigator Paul D. Clement, why Aereo is not simply a cable TV company. After all, she said, it has facilities that receive transmissions from broadcasters, then send the programs on to subscribers for a fee. Clement's response was that although Aereo is indistinguishable from cable operators in some respects, it is not one largely because the company does not want to be considered one. It fell to Aereo's attorney, David C. Frederick, to point out that Aereo does not collect TV programming and retransmit it in bulk to its subscribers, as cable operators do. Instead, it rents equipment to its subscribers, who use it to watch or record one show at a time. Nothing happens unless it is initiated by the user, he said. To which Sotomayor responded: \"I always thought that if I make a copy of a record and duplicate it a million times the way you are doing it, and I then go out and sell each of those copies to the public, then I am violating the Copyright Act. So why is it that you are not?\" As the question indicates, Sotomayor did not quite catch Frederick's point about who was actually making the recordings Aereo's subscribers and where they were being transmitted to themselves Or maybe she just rejected it as sophistry. Regardless, Frederick said legality of the recordings was not at issue because, as the broadcasters recognized earlier in the case, the Supreme Court held in the Sony Betamax case that people have a fair-use right to record TV shows for later viewing. The right question was the one Justice Elena Kagan eventually put to Clement: Why should copyright law treat a company that rents people a TV antenna hooked to an Internet-connected DVR different than one that sells people the functional equivalent to install at home? The answer, Clement said, was that a private performance becomes a public one when it is transmitted by a service provider from one place to another, rather than by a viewer to himself. Clement's formula ignores the YOU.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling in Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision, in which the appeals court ruled that a cable operator's shared DVR did not violate the networks' copyrights. Under the 2nd Circuit's ruling, who owns the equipment and where it is located are irrelevant to determining whether a performance is public or private. Instead, the court held, what matters is whether the equipment is controlled by users, and whether their recordings and transmissions are theirs alone. If the answer to those questions is yes, then it is a private performance. Aereo designed its service to comply with the 2nd Circuit's ruling, giving users total control over the equipment and making sure none of the recordings or streams was shared. Several justices focused on that aspect, pressing Frederick to say whether the company had any technological reason to use 10,000 dime-sized antennas. Frederick said it was cheaper to set up tiny remote antennas than to install rooftop ones on Manhattan skyscrapers, and to take a modular approach that could minimize the start-up's costs. That response, however, did not seem to mollify Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Antonin Scalia, who suggested that Aereo was just trying to \"get around copyright laws.\" One aspect of the case that seemed to help Aereo was the concern expressed by multiple justices about jeopardizing other cloud-based services, such as online storage lockers. Clement tried to reassure them, saying the difference between Aereo and a cloud-based storage service is like the difference between a car dealership and valet parking. One sells you a car, the other simply parks and returns the car you already own. That is a powerful metaphor, yet it is not quite apt. Aereo is not providing the TV programs, the broadcasters are. Its subscribers then use the equipment they rent from Aereo to tune in the program, make a copy and transmit it to themselves. That latter transmission is a private performance, not a public one, and it is separate legally from the public performance the broadcasters make when they put programs on air. Frederick said that if Clement was right about Aereo being a content provider, it would mean that any company providing an antenna or a DVR was a content provider. \"And if that is true,\" he argued, \"then the implications for the equipment industry are obviously quite massive, and you can understand why that would frighten the cloud computing industry because that turns them into public performers whenever they are handling content.\" A second problem for some justices was Clement's insistence that Aereo, unlike cable operators, would not qualify for a compulsory license to retransmit TV programs if the court ruled in the broadcasters' favor. Under a compulsory license, Aereo would have to pay broadcasters for the content but would not face the daunting task of negotiating for a license from each copyright owner. Clement offered cold comfort on that point. \"If they actually provide something that is a net benefit technologically, there is no reason people will not license them content,\" he told the justices. \"But on the other hand, if all they have is a gimmick, then they probably will go out of business, and nobody should cry a tear over that.\" ALSO: What we do not know about the killing of Anwar Awlaki Free trade on steroids: The threat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Follow Jon Healey on Twitter jcahealey and Google <doc_sep> Aereo, the streaming video service that everyone is talking about but few people actually have, defended its existence today in front of the YOU.S. Supreme Court while lawyers for the nation's broadcasters and the federal government looked to smash the company's tiny antennae into bits. legally speaking. You can read the whole transcript in this PDF. Like most SCOTUS transcripts, it actually makes for an amusing and thoughtful read, while showing that these hearings are much more about a group of people debating the issue instead of some camera-ready lawyer making a made-for-TV speech that knocks the justices' socks off. Since it will be months before the Supremes get around to issuing their opinion on this case, let us bide our time with some highlights from today's arguments. OF PHONOGRAPH RECORDS AND COAXIAL CABLE. At the core of the broadcasters' case is whether or not Aereo's system which uses arrays of antennae to pick up over-the-air TV signals and send them to paying users legally constitutes a \"public performance.\" Playing devil's advocate, Justice Breyer asked the broadcasters' attorney where one draws the line between actual transmission of a copyrighted performance and merely selling access to copyrighted content. \"Why is not what used to be called a phonograph record store that sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers a public performance?\" he inquired while at the same time showing his age The broadcasters countered that a record store is \"not involved in any performance at all\" but said the situation might be different for an online music store where one can both buy music and stream it from the cloud. \"If you provide downloads of music, you get a distribution license or a reproduction license,\" explained the broadcasters' attorney. \"If you provide streaming of music where you also have a contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a public performance license.\" Justice Sotomayor raised the concern that ruling in favor of the broadcasters may inadvertently result in problems for those that provide the required hardware for content delivery. She asked how one could write a ruling \"so that someone who sells coaxial cable to a resident of a building\" or sells passive storage equipment is not \"swept up\" in this issue. \"What does the Court do to avoid a definition or an acceptance of a definition that might make those people liable?\" asked Sotomayor. Once again, the broadcasters argued that hardware providers are not involved in the performance, but is just providing the tools needed for an end-user to access a private performance. \"That is different from an ongoing service, like a cable company or like Aereo,\" said the broadcasters' attorney, \"who still owns all these facilities and they are providing, through wire transmissions, these performances on an ongoing basis.\" AN ISSUE OF LOCATION Justice Kagan asked the broadcasters to clarify the importance of distance and location in making this distinction. \"In other words, if Aereo has the hardware in its warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to the particular end-user, that is going to make all the difference in the world as to whether we have a public performance or not a public performance,\" she asked. JUST SELLING THE HARDWARE. Justice Ginsburg asked Aereo why other transmitters, like cable companies and other online services, pay royalties but Aereo should not? \"The person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio Shack does not pay copyright royalties,\" explained Aereo, which maintains that all it does is rent people a service to access freely available TV feeds online. \"A company that provides a rental service for me to put an antenna in my home and install it, they do not pay copyright royalties either.\" The broadcasters admit that \"if you sell somebody hardware and all they are doing is transmitting it to themselves at their home, there is not going to be a transmission that is chargeable to the person who sold you the hardware,\" but countered that by having these streams coming from a remote location \"it becomes a public performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would be a private performance on behalf of the receiver.\" OF CAR DEALERS AND CLOUD COMPUTING It is that last distinction that the broadcasters believe allows them to challenge Aereo without putting all cloud-based computing and storage technology at risk. \"There is a fundamental difference between a service that. provides new content to all sorts of end-users essentially any paying stranger and a service that provides a locker, a storage service,\" argued the broadcasters, who used the analogous comparison of the difference between a car dealer and a valet parking service. Both of these services \"provide\" cars to people, but there is a huge difference in how they do it. \"If I show up at the car dealership without a car, I am going to be able to get a car. If I show up at the valet parking service and I do not own a car, it is not going to end well for me,\" explained the broadcasters. \"At the end of the day, the car dealer's providing cars to the public, the valet parking service is not. It is providing a parking service.\" But Chief Justice Roberts took issue with this analogy, asking if a better comparison might be between a personal garage and one that is open to the public; i.e., the choice between owning and renting. \"You can go to RadioShack and buy an antenna and a DVR or you can rent those facilities somewhere else from Aereo,\" said Roberts. \"They have got an antenna. They will let you use it when you need it and they can, you know, record the stuff as well and let you pick it up when you need it.\" Aereo contends that what the broadcasters' challenge goes too far and puts all of cloud-based tech at risk by trying to argue that having multiple copies stored of the same content somehow makes Aereo a public performer. \"It means that every time somebody stores something in the cloud whether it is a song, a video image or the like if it happens to be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is going to implicate the public performance right,\" argued Aereo's attorney. \"And that is why the cloud computing industry is freaked out about this case, because they have invested tens of billions of dollars on the notion that a user-specific, user-initiated copy, when perceived by that person, is a private performance and not a public performance.\" THE DEATH OF THE CLOUD DVR? Justice Kennedy asked the broadcasters to distinguish between Cablevision's cloud-based DVR whose legality has never been confirmed by the Supremes and the DVR service offered by Aereo. The broadcasters explain that while still taking issue with Cablevision's device the cable company has already obtained licenses for the initial performance of the programming but Aereo has not. \"Aereo is like if Cablevision. decides, 'Whew, we won, so guess what? Going forward, we are going to dispense with all these licenses, and we are just going to try to tell people we are just an RS DVR, that is all we are, and never mind that we do not have any licensed ability to get the broadcast in the first instance, and we are going to provide it to individual users, and it is all going to be because they push buttons and not because we push buttons.'\" Which is just a ridiculous claim, as the content that goes onto the Cablevision DVRs comes from programming aired on Cablevision's pay-TV network. It does not magically appear there. If Cablevision stopped offering new TV to customers, there would be nothing new to add to the DVRs and the stuff that is already on there would have already been licensed. making it a locker-type storage device that the broadcasters say they have no problem with. Aereo cited the 1984 SCOTUS ruling in favor of Sony, whose Betamax videotapes were going to ruin the Hollywood movie system by allowing people to record things and watch them over and over again. How much does the studio system thank itself for losing that case? \"In Sony, this Court held that consumers have a fair-use right to take local over-the-air broadcasts and make a copy of it,\" argued the company's lawyer. \"All Aereo is doing is providing antennas and DVRs that enable consumers to do exactly what this Court in Sony recognized they can do when they are in their home. and moving the equipment the antennas and the DVRs to the Internet.\" <doc_sep> Analysis In the digital age, perhaps only someone as old as Justice Stephen G. Breyer or older would fret about what might happen to a store that sells \"phonograph records.\" It is doubtful, in the extreme, whether there are any of those anymore, but no matter: Breyer and other Justices searched on Tuesday for ways to demonstrate that they want to be careful about what they do about today's modes of entertainment. With a new method of watching TV via an Internet connection before the Court for analysis, the Court moved back and forth between killing that novelty by forcing it to pay sizable fees to download copyrighted TV programs, or giving it a fighting legal chance to survive as a cheaper alternative to cable. Aside from struggling somewhat to learn just how this new entry in home entertainment actually works, the hour-long hearing in American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc., found the Court quite worried about \"the cloud.\" That is that capacious site, somewhere in the electronic firmament, where all manner of digital expression and indulgences are stored. Maybe even a Super Bowl replay, or two. One lawyer sought to persuade the Court that the cloud is falling, so to speak, while another said not to worry about it, and a third said it means nothing legally if it is only used with \"a gimmick.\" All three of those positions cannot be true, but the Court left little doubt that it will have to spend some time and effort exploring which one of them if any can be believed. The legal issue before the Court is misleadingly simple: is Aereo violating copyright law with its system of renting out thousands of tiny antennas to a growing throng of customers so they can pick and choose the TV programs they want to watch, pulling them from \"the cloud\" whenever the mood stirs them to do so? Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., repeated several times his perception that the only reason Aereo put that system together was to engineer its way around the copyright laws. And, as a general matter, his skepticism seemed to be fairly widely shared across the bench. But there were indications that some members of the Court were thinking that, perhaps, the copyright issue had already been settled in Aereo's favor six years ago, in a lower court decision that the Justices had in fact chosen then not even to review. That ruling goes by the short-form name of Cablevision, because it involved a cable operator's system of maintaining a computer hard drive at its place of business which allowed customers to call up from storage a desired digital recording for viewing at home, using a copy available only to that one user. It was that decision, by the YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that led that court to uphold the legality of Aereo's system, finding that it, too, depended mainly upon consumer choice, so there was no public performance of the copyrighted material when the customer downloaded it. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that the lawyers pretend that Cablevision was a ruling by the Supreme Court, so what should be made of it in the context of Aereo's situation? It was the best hope for Aereo, because that company and its lawyers have basically argued that the whole legal issue surrounding its system is solved because the individual consumer makes all of the choices; thus, no illegal public performance of copyrighted works. But, in the context of the argument Tuesday, that was a fine legal point. Most of the energy, at least from the bench, was about the risk that the Court might rule in this case in a way that would smother the infant of digital innovation in its electronic crib. After Justice Breyer first got such a worry on the table with his antique reference to wax recordings of music that are played with a needle, of all things, Justice Sonia Sotomayor did a bit of updating, and asked about the impact on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" She confessed her concern, saying \"this is really hard for me.\" She was, of course, looking for reassurance. The over-the-air TV broadcasting industry's lawyer, Washington attorney Paul D. Clement, was not in the reassuring business on Tuesday. He dismissed Aereo as a pirate of copyrighted music, not a simple peddler of hardware that people could use at home to watch TV. \"Aereo,\" he said, coolly, \"still owns all these facilities and they are providing, through wire transmissions, these performances on an ongoing basis.\" Sensing, perhaps, that he needed to make things simpler, Clement tried to show the distinction through a \"real-world analogy\" between a car dealer and a vendor of a valet parking service. Both of them, he said, provide cars to the public, but the dealer is providing a car, while the valet parker provides a service. Aereo, he implied, is a service provider, not just a product dispenser. The exchanges continued in that vein with a federal government lawyer, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart, who is mostly siding with the broadcasters. He seemed to have a little less technical knowledge than some of the Justices, but that did not much deter him from suggesting that the Court need not worry much in this case about \"the cloud,\" which he seemed to prefer calling \"pure cloud locker service.\" He was candid enough, though, to tell Justice Kennedy that, if the Court interprets the Cablevision decision as validating the individual consumer as the one who chooses to \"perform\" a copyrighted work, then \"it is hard to see how you could rule in favor of our position here.\" Aereo's lawyer, Washington attorney David C. Frederick, could not have had a better lead-in to his argument than Stewart's concession. Aereo's whole case, he made clear throughout his argument, depends upon the Court looking at Aereo's system as seeing only the end-user, calling up his or her own downloads for private viewing. All that his client does, Frederick said, \"is attempting to entice consumers to replicate on the cloud what they can do at home at lower cap costs and more efficiency.\" It is like using the Internet, he added: \"You cannot do multiple channels on the Internet anyway. You can only do a single video stream at a time. So whether you have one big antenna or whether you have lots of little antenna as Aereo does you still have to compress the signal and only one can go over the Internet at a time.\" His ultimate rhetorical weapon, though, given the concerns of the Justices about where this case potentially might lead, was a repeated suggestion that \"the cloud computer industry\" is deeply worried about how the Court might rule. If what Aereo does is illegal, he argued, \"every time somebody stores something in the cloud, whether it is a song, a video image or the like, if it happens to be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is going to implicate the public performance right, that is why the cloud computing industry is freaked out about this case.\" No more so, it seemed, than the Justices themselves.

    "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in ABC v. Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television-implications the justices did not seem comfortable with. Aereo allows users to record broadcast TV online and watch it at their leisure. The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it is simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here is how the arguments went: \"If you are comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which is not true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world is not, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It is not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I do not find that very satisfying. I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices did not seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I do not see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

    "document": "President Trump's legal team believes Attorney General Jeff Session's Justice Department and the FBI more than special counsel Robert Mueller himself are to blame for what they see as a witch hunt. The result: They want an additional special counsel named to investigate the investigators. Trump officials outlined their new line of thinking to me last night. <doc_sep> Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his team of a dozen-plus lawyers and investigators have proven stealthy in their wide-ranging Russia probe. They have surprised the White House with one indictment after another, and summoned President Trump's confidants for lengthy interviews. In the case of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort alone, court filings show, they have collected more than 400,000 documents and 36 electronic devices. Mueller and his deputies are, in the fearful word of some Trump loyalists, \"killers.\" Trump's response, by contrast, is being directed by John M. Dowd, the president's personal lawyer retired from a large firm who works essentially as a one-man band, and Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer who works out of a small office in the West Wing basement, near the cafeteria where staffers get lunch. Dowd and Cobb, along with attorney Jay Sekulow, serve not only as Trump's lawyers but also as his strategists, publicists, therapists and based on Dowd's claim that he wrote a controversial presidential tweet ghostwriters. When Mueller requests documents, they provide them. When Trump reacts to new twists in the Russia saga, they seek to calm him down. When he has questions about the law, such as the Logan Act or Magnitsky Act, they explain it. And when the president frets that Mueller may be getting too close to him, they assure him he has done nothing wrong, urge him to resist attacking the special counsel and insist that the investigation is wrapping up first, they said, by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas and now by early next year. As lawyers for the world's highest-profile client, Dowd and Cobb have come under scrutiny for their every move and utterance and the criticism has been harsh. Many in the Washington legal community chide them as being indiscreet, error-prone and outmatched. They say public blunders such as Dowd and Cobb casually chatting about their legal strategy on the patio of a downtown Washington steakhouse in September within earshot of a reporter suggest a lack of discipline. Critics also question why, seven months into Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, they have not assembled a battalion of lawyers as President Bill Clinton had when he was being investigated by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. And some Trump loyalists, spoiling for a fight, say the president's lawyers should be combative rather than cooperative with Mueller. \"There certainly have been gaffes,\" said Alan Dershowitz, a criminal defense attorney and Harvard Law School professor who has won praise from Trump for his television appearances defending a president's constitutional prerogative to fire his FBI director. \"These are not the kinds of things that one would expect from the most powerful man in America, who has a choice of anybody to be his defense counsel,\" Dershowitz said. \"Well almost anybody,\" he added, saying that he is not interested in the job. Trump's legal team faces tensions and a client who often takes his own counsel Lawyer Ty Cobb, left, in 2004 and Jay Sekulow, in 2015. The two, along with John Dowd, are representing President Trump in the Russia probe, serving as his strategists, publicists and therapists. AP photos AP photos This portrait of Trump's legal team and defense strategy is based on interviews with more than two dozen White House officials, lawyers and other people connected to the Russia probe, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. The chorus of criticism may be growing louder, but Trump is not singing along. By most accounts, the president is satisfied with his representation and talks to Cobb several times a day though advisers say he has occasionally discussed bringing on new lawyers. Trump, 71, connects with Dowd, 76, and Cobb, in his mid-60s, as contemporaries. He appreciates their no-nonsense old-school style, and likes that neither appears on television, believing their absence from the airwaves deprives what he calls the Russia \"witch hunt\" of oxygen, according to Trump's advisers. A former Marine Corps captain, Dowd has a gruff demeanor and has proven able at times to cool Trump's temper and convince him of the virtues of pragmatism over pugnacity, aides said. Some Trump advisers dismiss Cobb's predictions that the Mueller probe is nearing its conclusions as misleading happy talk, but the president has internalized it as reality. One reason for Trump's faith is his belief that his lawyers are plugged in. Cobb tells him he is in frequent, and sometimes daily, contact with the special counsel's office, according to people familiar with the dynamic. Over Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump boasted to friends that Cobb was \"brilliant\" and that he was certain Mueller would soon exonerate him. Cobb declined to comment, and Dowd responded to an email inquiry with two words: \"No, thanks.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \"The president is happy with his legal team.\" Cobb works as a White House lawyer whose salary is paid by the government, and his duty is to the office of the presidency, whereas Dowd and Sekulow are employed by Trump and represent him personally. Dowd and Sekulow enjoy attorney-client privilege, but Cobb does not meaning that Mueller could seek access to Cobb's notes or ask to interview him about his interactions with the president. Trump lawyer John Dowd brought down Pete Rose. Almost 30 years later, they are still fighting. Mark Corallo, a Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, served as spokesman for Trump's legal team earlier this year. Corallo is no longer involved, but he praised Dowd and Cobb as \"titans.\" \"They have been at the top of their profession and were on the shortlist of the top 10 attorneys you would call if you got your knickers in a twist,\" Corallo said. He added, \"One thing I like is Cobb and Dowd are of the same generation as the president. They are contemporaries. There is a comfort that comes with being able to talk with somebody who shares your experience in the world.\" Still, there have been moments of tension. Last Tuesday, anxiety ran high early in the morning because of a report out of Germany that Mueller's office had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to the transactions of Trump and people close to him. Trump was unnerved, but his lawyers tried to soothe his irritation and scrambled to determine whether the report was accurate, aware that if Mueller were digging into Trump's finances, he would be crossing a red line the president had publicly set, according to three people familiar with the discussions. After the lawyers consulted with the special counsel's office, Sekulow issued a statement that afternoon saying that Trump's team had confirmed there was no subpoena for Trump's records. The Trump administration's key people in the Russia investigation including the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner are represented by different attorneys. But some of the various lawyers, along with Dowd and Cobb, cooperate by sharing information on regular conference calls about questions their clients have been asked and documents they have turned over. Witnesses in Mueller's probe and their lawyers have reported back to Cobb and Dowd that the special counsel's team has asked detailed questions about Trump's May firing of James B. Comey as FBI director, leading them to believe that Mueller may be gathering evidence of obstruction of justice, according to one witness. But Cobb and Dowd have told Trump he has no vulnerability, officials said. Dowd went so far as to posit last week to Axios that a president cannot obstruct justice because of his constitutional powers as the chief law enforcement officer an interpretation that was mocked by some legal scholars. A bold new legal defense for Trump: Presidents cannot obstruct justice On December 2, Trump tweeted that he fired Michael Flynn as national security adviser in part because he had lied to the FBI an admission that could become evidence in an obstruction investigation. Dowd claimed he drafted the tweet, and fellow lawyers privately said they could not believe a statement so careless was written not by the impulsive president but by his lawyer. One of Trump's advisers told the president that weekend: \"The first job of a lawyer is to shut up. The second job of a lawyer is to keep their client's mouth shut. I do not know why they are tweeting and talking and trying to explain the tweet,\" according to someone with knowledge of the conversation. People close to the Trump legal team argue that additional lawyers could result in a more proactive and careful approach. \"It is amazing the stress and magnitude of representing the president of the United States,\" said one person familiar with the inner workings. \"You would have to be super human to do it alone. You have got 16 of the best lawyers in the country going up against you.\" For Trump, being under the glare of a legal investigation is familiar territory. A real estate developer and reality-television star before becoming a politician, he has spent much of his professional life enmeshed in litigation. When Mueller's Russia investigation began in May, Trump hired as his lead attorney Marc Kasowitz, a litigator from New York with a brawler reputation who had represented Trump and his companies off and on for years in divorce, bankruptcy and other proceedings. In the early weeks of the Mueller probe, the hard-charging Kasowitz would scurry in and out of the Oval Office and the adjoining dining room in what aides described as a running and at times frenzied commentary with Trump about all things Russia. But Kasowitz had scant experience in Washington and with investigations like Mueller's. After he caused a kerfuffle by sending an expletive-laced and disparaging email to a stranger who had criticized him, Kasowitz departed the Russia legal team. He continues to represent Trump in some other matters. When Trump goes looking for a media brawl, this feared lawyer steps in Trump tried to hire or has considered hiring more than a half dozen top litigators to help manage the Russia probe, including William A. Burck, Mark Filip, Emmet Flood, Robert J. Giuffra, Ted B. Olson and Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., according to several people with knowledge of the president's deliberations. For various reasons, none took the job. \"If you are the president of the United States, typically the top lawyers are lining up to pitch you,\" said one person close to the White House and familiar with the legal team's dynamics. \"Here, you have the opposite.\" Bob Bauer, who was President Barack Obama's White House counsel, said in assessing the Trump legal team: \"Some people may want to blame the lawyers, but my principal question is, 'How do you represent a client like Trump?' And at what point do these lawyers decide they are so hemmed in, so compromised by his behavior, his impulses, his tweets, that they just cannot represent him effectively?\" The face of the legal team has been Sekulow, who has deep ties to the Christian right, though he has adopted a lower profile since the spring and summer when he was a frequent television presence. Cobb, who had been a partner at Hogan Lovells, enjoys a reputation as a seasoned white-collar advocate whose last high-stakes legal case involving Washington politics was in the 1990s. Dowd has been a higher-profile criminal defender and represented Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. during a 1990 ethics investigation into whether McCain had improperly intervened in a savings and loan probe. He is perhaps best known for representing the commissioner of baseball in the late 1980s and producing the \"Dowd Report,\" a document that resulted in Pete Rose's lifetime suspension from the sport. Dowd was widely perceived by other lawyers to be in the twilight of his career, having formally retired in 2015 from Akin Gump, where he had worked since 1990. Dowd lost one of his most recent big cases when his client, hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, was convicted in 2011 on insider trading charges in New York. Preet Bharara, the YOU.S. attorney prosecuting Rajaratnam, reflected on facing Dowd in that trial in an episode last week of his podcast, \"Stay Tuned with Preet.\" \"John Dowd said a lot of how shall I put it? ludicrous, silly things,\" said Bharara, who was fired as YOU.S. attorney two months into the Trump administration. At one point, Dowd was filmed swearing at and flashing his middle finger at reporters covering the trial. It garnered him unflattering press coverage but it was the kind of dramatic move that a client like Trump could see as an attribute. Sari Horwitz and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. <doc_sep> EXCLUSIVE: A senior Justice Department official demoted last week for concealing his meetings with the men behind the anti-Trump \"dossier\" had even closer ties to Fusion GPS, the firm responsible for the incendiary document, than have been disclosed, Fox News has confirmed: The official's wife worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election. Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence HPSCI confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr's duties including whether she worked on the dossier remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016. Fusion GPS has attracted scrutiny because Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page. \"The House Intelligence Committee,\" Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News in a statement on Monday, \"is looking into all facets of the connections between the Department of Justice and Fusion GPS, including Mr. Ohr.\" Until December 6, when Fox News began making inquiries about him, Bruce Ohr held two titles at DOJ. He was, and remains, director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force; but his other job was far more senior. Mr. Ohr held the rank of associate deputy attorney general, a post that gave him an office four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The day before Fox News reported that Mr. Ohr held his secret meetings last year with the founder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier, the Justice Department stripped Ohr of his deputy title and ousted him from his fourth floor office at the building that DOJ insiders call \"Main Justice.\" The Department of Justice has provided no public explanation for Ohr's demotion. Officials inside the Department have told Fox News his wearing of two hats was \"unusual,\" but also confirm Ohr had withheld his contacts with the Fusion GPS men from colleagues at the DOJ. Former FBI Director James Comey has described the dossier as a compendium of \"salacious and unverified\" allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump and his associates, including Page, a foreign policy adviser. The dossier was provided to the FBI in July 2016, shortly before then-candidate Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination. As Comey later testified, it was in that same month that the FBI began a counterintelligence probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The disclosure by Fox News that Bruce Ohr met with Simpson and Steele last year expanded the reach of the dossier's creators from the FBI into the top echelons of the Justice Department. Initial investigation suggested that Steele, a longtime FBI informant whose contacts with Mr. Ohr are said to date back a decade, might have played the central role in putting Simpson together with the associate deputy attorney general. Now, the revelation that Mrs. Ohr worked for Simpson calls that account into question. A review of open source materials shows Mrs. Ohr was described as a Russia expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, when she worked there, briefly, a decade ago. The Center's website said her project focused on the experiences of Russian farmers during Stalin's collectivization program and following the invasion of Russia by Nazi forces in 1941. She has also reviewed a number of books about twentieth century Russia, including Reconstructing the State: Personal Networks and Elite Identity in Soviet Russia 2000 by Gerald Easter, a political scientist at Boston College, and Bertrand M. Patenaude's The Big Show in Bololand: The American Relief Expedition to Soviet Russia in the Famine of 1921 2002 Contacted by Fox News late Monday, DOJ officials declined to comment. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, declined to comment on the original disclosure about Mr. Ohr's secret meetings, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mrs. Ohr. While Nunes has issued numerous subpoenas to DOJ and FBI relating to the dossier, and has threatened contempt-of-Congress citations against Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray for what congressional Republicans have termed \"stonewalling\" by the two agencies, Schiff has mostly objected to the demands for documents and witnesses, casting the entire dossier probe as innately political. \"I think there is a hope that if they can impeach Christopher Steele, and they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, maybe they can impeach the whole Russia investigation,\" Schiff told MSNBC in September. James Rosen joined FOX News Channel FNC in 1999 and is the network's chief Washington correspondent.",

But Mike Allen of Axios reports on another strategy being explored by the president's legal team: Appoint a second special counsel to investigate Mueller's investigation. The story suggests that Trump's attorneys trust Mueller himself but not others in the Justice Department. For example, they point to a Fox News story Monday detailing how the wife of a Justice Department official named Bruce Ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier that emerged during the election. Ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company, Fusion GPS. \"The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow tells Axios. \"These new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.\" It is not clear how likely this is to happen, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of GOP concerns.

And, he said, the perceived weakness of the response has encouraged China to push limits in international waters and forced Britain to increase its security measures in the face of threats from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \"The United States seems to be in the malaise of not being that concerned,\" Rogers said. \"If you have your own European allies saying, 'Maybe the United States is not a leader on this issue,' that is a problem for us.\" Read more about: Barack Obama, Iraq, Russia, Foreign Policy, Mike Rogers, Syria <doc_sep> Sen.

Flynt, who built an empire of smut starting with Hustler magazine, is a longtime Democratic supporter. \"The thought of Donald Trump becoming president nauseates me in a big way,\" Flynt told Toronto-based HOSS magazine. And if Trump wins? \"I do not know, maybe move to Canada,\" Flynt, 73, said. The porn potentate, whose company has produced X-rated video fare like Asian Fever 12, Barely Legal 151 and The Porn Identity, admits he follows politics intensely. \"I wish I did not. I do not know why I let it obsess me the way it does,\" he told the magazine.

Chelsea Handler says she will move to her house in Spain. Lena Dunham is eyeing Vancouver. His reply: \"Well, she is a B-actor. And you know, has no mojo.\" Jon Stewart says he might just leave the planet entirely. Why are all these celebrities on the move? They cannot abide Donald Trump. Handler, Dunham and Stewart are among many celebrities who have said, jokingly or otherwise, that if Trump is elected, they will leave the United States. Many would consider moving to Canada. There is a website called cbiftrumpwins.com Cape Breton If Donald Trump Wins that shows off the beauty of the Canadian island and suggests people come there. The site advertises the island's good weather, affordable housing, magnificent scenery and friendly people; it is had over a million visits. Since the beginning of 2016, a surprising number of celebs have gone on record to say that a Trump presidential win will prompt them to move. Cher, for example, said she would move to Jupiter if Trump got elected. At the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Vanity Fair magazine captured a dozen famed folk talking about their plans to flee a Trump-led America; Armie Hammer, star of The Social Network and The Man from YOU.N.C.L.E. came up with the great idea of moving to the Caribbean and starting a Jet Ski business. Some of the others who weighed in include Chloe Sevigny, who says she will move to Nova Scotia if Trump becomes president, Elizabeth Moss, who says she is always had a hankering to live in Italy, and Kathryn Hahn, who opted for Iceland rather than sticking around, should Trump sit in the Oval Office. Anyone who has seen Hahn in the spectacularly funny film Bad Moms, which opens Friday, knows this would be Iceland's gain. Lily Rose Depp says she would live in France. Gabrielle Union might go to the Bahamas. Zosia Mamet was no doubt kidding when she said she would move to Siberia. Let these 10 high profile types tell you themselves: LENA DUNHAM: \"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will. I know a lovely place in Vancouver, and I can get my work done from there.\" JENNY SLATE: \"If Donald Trump wins the presidency, a pig will fly out of my butthole, because it will be a nightmare.\" MILEY CYRUS: \"Honestly f- this s- I am moving if this is my president!

Can Trump-and we-come together and save America for the second time? Want to connect with Dinesh D'Souza online for more hard-hitting analysis of current events in America? Here is how: Facebook: https: www.facebook.com dsouzadinesh Twitter: https: twitter.com dineshdsouza Instagram: https: www.instagram.com dineshjdsouza Email: http: www.dineshdsouza.com email <doc_sep> On May 31, President Donald Trump, one of America's premiere conservative trolls, decided to pardon Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative writer and documentarian whose penchant for trolling and needling liberals, and embracing conspiracy theories in the process, rivals that of Trump himself. If that comparison seems unfair, just watch the trailer for D'Souza's 2016 film, Hillary's America: It references D'Souza's past conviction for violating campaign finance law for which Trump is pardoning him portraying his prosecution as a politically motivated witch hunt, and seeks to tie the current Democratic party to the Ku Klux Klan and slaveowners Democrats were historically the pro-segregation, pro-slavery party until the parties flipped on race around 1964 It features a cameo from Jonah Goldberg, the National Review writer best known for his universally discredited attempt to equate New Deal liberalism with European fascism. It is peppered with over-the-top voiceovers by D'Souza \"What are these Democrats hiding?\"; \"What if the goal of the Democratic party is to steal the most valuable thing the world has ever produced? What if their plan is to steal America?\" over an ominous, melodramatic score. This kind of silliness and purposeful provocation on race is D'Souza's bread and butter. See this tweet from 2015: YOU CAN TAKE THE BOY OUT OF THE GHETTO.Watch this vulgar man show his stuff, while America cowers in embarrassment pic.twitter.com C9yLG4QoOK Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 18, 2015 After people on Twitter pointed out that this is extremely racist, D'Souza replied with the most tepid of quasi-apologies: I know Obama was not actually raised in a ghetto-I am using the term metaphorically, to suggest his unpresidential conduct Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 18, 2015 Someone with only a light exposure to D'Souza's oeuvre might be tempted to dismiss this and Hillary's America as ludicrous attention grabs from a fringe criminal, and perhaps they would be right to do so. But D'Souza was for decades a member in good standing of American conservative intellectual life, who served in the Reagan administration; was affiliated with serious, respected conservative think tanks; and was a big player in the campus right's 1980s rise to prominence. In 2007, that suddenly started to change, and his work took on a more conspiratorial, hyperbolic tone, culminating in stuff like the Obama selfie stick tweet. At the same time, D'Souza's work has become more popular, and arguably even more influential. And throughout, he is expressed same attitude toward race displayed in that tweet. And now, with Trump as president, D'Souza is finally being welcomed back into the conservative mainstream, as a pioneer of the kind of politics our president has brought to the national stage. Here is a basic primer on who D'Souza is, and how he got to this point. 1 Who is Dinesh D'Souza? Dinesh D'Souza is an American conservative writer and commentator. He briefly worked in the Reagan White House on domestic policy issues from 1987 to 1988; has served as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute AEI and the Hoover Institution; and was president of The King's College, a small evangelical school in Manhattan, from 2010 to 2012. But D'Souza is probably best known for his writing. He is written 16 books, many of them best-sellers, most of which either critique liberal attitudes on race and gender Illiberal Education, The End of Racism defend the concept of America against perceived enemies What is So Great About America, America: Imagine a World Without Her or defend orthodox Christian theology What is So Great About Christianity, Life After Death: The Evidence He is also taken a turn into documentary filmmaking in recent years. His 2012 film 2016: Obama's America is the fourth-best-performing documentary at the box office ever, and the second-best-performing political documentary after Fahrenheit 9 11. He followed it up with America: Imagine the World Without Her, based on the book of the same name, which was released in 2014. 2 How did D'Souza's career start? D'Souza first came to prominence as a student at Dartmouth he graduated in 1983 where he was one of the first editors of the Dartmouth Review, a still-extant conservative campus publication. During his time there, the Review: The last of those incidents prompted then-classmate and future Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to go up to D'Souza at a coffee shop and ask him \"how it felt to be such a dick,\" an event Geithner recounted in his memoir Stress Test and in an interview with Vox: After graduating from Dartmouth, D'Souza moved to Princeton, New Jersey, to edit a small magazine called Prospect, which targeted Princeton students and was overseen by a conservative alumni group, Concerned Alumni for Princeton, that counted future Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito among its members. D'Souza's most infamous article at Prospect concerned a freshman whose mother had stopped paying tuition upon discovering her daughter was having sex with a fellow student. D'Souza was outraged that Princeton offered the student financial aid after her mother stopped supporting her. Students reacted poorly to the violation of their classmate's privacy, organizing a petition condemning D'Souza. From Prospect, D'Souza moved to the magazine Policy Review, then affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, and from there to the Reagan administration. He opted to go to AEI rather than join the George H. W. Bush administration, and started writing his most successful books there before leaving for the Hoover Institution in 2001, where he remained until 2007. 3 What does D'Souza believe? Probably the best way to interrogate D'Souza's beliefs is by going through what his major books argued. Illiberal Education 1991 is a fairly standard-issue critique of what D'Souza deems \"political correctness\" on college campuses, focusing in particular on affirmative action policies in both student admissions and faculty hiring, and on what D'Souza saw as an abandonment of the traditional Western canon through the inclusion of more modern female, non-white, and non-heterosexual writers. The book got a largely respectful reception, with Tom Wolfe, Robert Bork, and most strikingly Morton Halperin then the ACLU's DC director and a fairly down-the-line liberal providing blurbs. Nancy Dye, then an English professor at Vassar, was less positive, writing in the New York Times, \"Mr. D'Souza has constructed his argument by cobbling together anecdotal accounts of campus incidents.\" The End of Racism 1995 was considerably more incendiary. Here are a few lines from the book: The book got a respectful hearing in some corners; historian George Frederickson called it the \"most thorough, intelligent, and well-informed presentation of the case against liberal race policies that has yet appeared\" in the New York Review of Books. By contrast, philosopher Richard Rorty wrote a takedown for the New York Times, consisting largely of direct quotations from the book, and concluding, \"Conceivably somebody could make a case for the claim that white Americans are now entitled to relax, go color-blind, and let the African-Americans rebuild their culture on their own. Mr. D'Souza has not even begun to make it.\" Economist Glenn Loury and community activist Paul Ryan mentor Robert Woodson, who are both black, resigned their posts at AEI in protest of the book. The Virtue of Prosperity 2000 released in the midst of the dot-com boom, is a celebration of the new wave of capitalism, and in particular the fact that going into business and making money is \"seen as cool.\" He is even enthusiastic about biological enhancements to human life, musing that perhaps \"the history of our species can be written with the epitaph that we tried out humanity, found it wanting, and opted for something better.\" The book, understandably, caused much less of a stir than The End of Racism had, but as Slate's Tim Noah noted at the time, it is notable for containing a critique of the very idea of equality of opportunity. It is unfair, D'Souza argues, for the state to deny his daughter the edge he is attempted to give her through sending her to great schools, offering her ballet and chess lessons, and so on: Now, to enforce equal opportunity, the government could do one of two things: it could try to pull my daughter down, or it could work to raise other people's children up. The first is clearly destructive and immoral, but the second is also unfair. The government is obliged to treat all citizens equally. Why should it work to undo the benefits that my wife and I have labored so hard to provide? Why should it offer more to children whose parents have not taken the trouble? What is So Great About America and Letters to a Young Conservative followed, but D'Souza's next major book was 2007's The Enemy at Home. 4 What was The Enemy at Home and why was it so controversial? The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9 11 argues exactly what its name implies. \"In faulting the cultural left, I am not making the absurd accusation that this group blew up the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,\" he writes. \"I am saying that the cultural left and its allies in Congress, the media, Hollywood, the nonprofit sector, and the universities are the primary because of the volcano of anger toward America that is erupting from the Islamic world. The Muslims who carried out the 9 11 attacks were the product of this visceral rage.\" He provides an actual list of the people he is blaming at the end of the book, breaking them up into the Congressional Left Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Mikulski the Intellectual Left Eric Hobsbawm, Cornel West, Tony Judt the Hollywood Left Barbra Streisand, Harry Belafonte, Jane Fonda the Activist Left Michael Moore, George Soros, Mumia Abu-Jamal the Foreign Policy Left Gore Vidal, Seymour Hersh, Jimmy Carter and the Cultural Left Al Franken, Salman Rushdie, Ellen Willis What is the Matter with Kansas? author Thomas Frank has the distinction of appearing twice, as a member of both the Intellectual and Cultural Left. The Enemy at Home was rejected by much of the conservative movement, not least because of the implication that D'Souza agrees with some Islamist critiques of Western culture. For instance, D'Souza writes, \"the political right and the Islamic fundamentalists are on the same wavelength on social issues,\" and, \"Yes I would rather go to a baseball game or have a drink with Michael Moore than with the grand mufti of Egypt. But when it comes to core beliefs, I would have to confess that I am closer to the dignified fellow in the long robe and prayer beads than to the slovenly fellow with the baseball cap.\" National Review hosted a symposium on the book that was overwhelmingly negative. Roger Kimball, who had issued a glowing review of Illiberal Education, wrote, \"The problem with The Enemy at Home is well, everything.\" Military historian Victor Davis Hanson wrote, \"It is the singular achievement of D'Souza that his bizarre writ has for a moment earned universal condemnation from those who can agree on little else.\" Liberals, of course, joined in the critique. \"Ordinarily I would never equate hard-right views on social issues with the rantings of an Islamist terrorist,\" Noah wrote. \"I do so now only because D'Souza has written an entire book encouraging me to do just that.\" By the end of the year, D'Souza had left the Hoover Institution, a development that Newsweek's David Sessions, in a profile of D'Souza, suggests was hardly accidental. BONUS QUESTION Can I get a music break? Sort of? There is no obvious musical accompaniment to D'Souza's career, but this is better, I promise. D'Souza appeared in an infomercial for his friend Bruce Schooley's invention, the Fliptree: a pre-lit, multi-component artificial Christmas tree designed to be easy to move and store. It is delightful: Thanks to Elon Green for the pointer. 5 What is D'Souza's view of Barack Obama? Not positive! D'Souza has a distinctive grand unifying theory of Obama, expressed in a 2010 Forbes feature; his books The Roots of Obama's Rage, America: Imagine a World Without Her, and Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream; and his two documentaries. He rejects the frequent conservative attack that Obama is a European-style or perhaps Alinskyan socialist at heart, arguing instead that Obama is best understood through the lens of anticolonialism, in particular Kenya's struggle against British imperialism. Obama was taught by his father, D'Souza argues, to view the US as an imperialist actor trampling upon states both through outright war as in Vietnam or Iraq and through economic exploitation, a natural successor to the more formal role that the British Empire played in much of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. \"From a very young age and through his formative years, Obama learned to see America as a force for global domination and destruction,\" D'Souza writes. \"He came to view America's military as an instrument of neocolonial occupation. He adopted his father's position that capitalism and free markets are code words for economic plunder.\" Everything Obama does can be understood in light of these fundamental commitments, D'Souza believes: \"Why support oil drilling off the coast of Brazil but not in America? Obama believes that the West uses a disproportionate share of the world's energy resources, so he wants neocolonial America to have less and the former colonized countries to have more Obama supports the Ground Zero mosque because to him 9 11 is the event that unleashed the American bogey and pushed us into Iraq and Afghanistan. He views some of the Muslims who are fighting against America abroad as resisters of YOU.S. imperialism.\" As was the case with The Enemy at Home, many conservatives rejected D'Souza's theory as preposterous, noting that there are plenty of other, much more plausible explanations for why the Democratic president has pursued policies roughly in line with the Democratic platform, and that Obama's memoir made it very clear that he, far from wanting to emulate his father's politics, was deeply disappointed in him. In a particularly pointed piece, The Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson identified \"misstatements of fact, leaps in logic, and pointlessly elaborate argumentation\" throughout the book. \"There is, indeed, a name for the beliefs that motivate President Obama, but it is not anticolonialism; it is not even socialism. It is liberalism!\" he writes. \"Nearly everything that Obama has done as president, including the policies that D'Souza cites as proof of his inherited anticolonial ideology, would have been as eagerly pursued by President John Edwards or President John Kerry.\" For liberals, meanwhile, \"Kenyan anticolonialist\" became something of a punchline. Matt Steinglass at the Economist decided to turn the tables on D'Souza and concocted a byzantine explanation for D'Souza's conservatism, based upon his family's caste, Catholicism, and position within the Portuguese Indian territory of Goa, that is just as unnecessary as D'Souza's explanation for Obama's liberalism. James Mann at the New Republic added, for good measure, \"anti-colonialism is itself not exactly alien to American traditions; our country was founded on it.\" But some important conservatives took D'Souza seriously. In 2010, Newt Gingrich called his argument \"the most profound insight I have read in the past six years about Barack Obama,\" adding, \"Only if you understand Kenyan, anticolonial behavior can you piece together Obama's actions That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior.\" 6 What are these D'Souza scandals from a few years back? There are two D'Souza scandals, more or less. The first came and went in 2012, when World Magazine a prominent evangelical publication reported that D'Souza had been spotted at a conference with a woman who was not his wife. He repeatedly introduced her as his fiance, despite the fact that he was still married, and checked into a nearby hotel with her. Court records show that he only even filed for divorce the day that World called him for comment. D'Souza wound up resigning his role as president of King's College. The scandal was complicated by the fact that World's editor-in-chief, Marvin Olasky, had left his role as King's provost upon D'Souza's appointment as president, and the reporter writing the story, Warren Cole Smith, had been a consultant to the school before being let go by D'Souza. The second, much more significant scandal involves payments he made to his mistress who he has since broken up with and her husband, as well as another couple, to reimburse them for donations made to Wendy Long, the longshot Republican nominee running against Kristen Gillibrand for US Senate in New York in 2012. Long was a Dartmouth classmate of D'Souza's and also wrote for the Review. It is illegal to reimburse for donations, since it effectively allows you to give in excess of contribution limits. In this case, D'Souza funneled 20,000 in money through four friends to Long, far above the 5,000 individual contribution limit and that is not even counting the 5,000 he gave her himself D'Souza was caught, and indicted. D'Souza pled guilty to one count of making illegal contributions in the names of others, but has claimed throughout that he is being selectively prosecuted by the Obama administration for his political beliefs. Prosecutors, led by prominent US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, pushed for D'Souza to be sentenced to 10-16 months in federal prison. Judge Richard Berman spared him jail time, sentencing him to eight months in a community confinement center, five years probation, and a 30,000 fine. But Berman categorically rejected the idea that D'Souza was a victim of selective prosecution: \"That is nonsense. Spin is what that is.\" D'Souza served his sentence at a community confinement center in San Diego. He told Fox News' Megyn Kelly during that time that he would check into the center between 7 and 9 pm every night and sleep there, but was otherwise free to do what he likes with his days in general. He was required to stay in the San Diego area for the duration of the sentence, and his media interviews were subject to review by his probation officer. His was released from community confinement on May 31, 2015: HE IS BAAAACK: After eight months of overnight captivity, I am done with my confinement as of 4 am this morning! pic.twitter.com rcd3ufyqxw Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza May 31, 2015 7 How is D'Souza still so popular, if even many conservatives reject him now? If D'Souza is no longer accepted by most conservative intellectuals, then he is more than made up for it by making inroads into more conspiracy-oriented conservative circles. His theory of Obama has been embraced by Glenn Beck; InfoWars' Alex Jones brought D'Souza on his show to lament his political persecution by the Obama administration. \"Viewed through the lens of the intelligentsia and the media elite, D'Souza has suffered a tragicomic fall from grace, undone by some combination of conspiratorial thinking, pseudo-academic posturing, and hubris,\" Simon van Zuylen-Wood wrote in a 2013 profile for National Journal. \"But in a separate, larger universe, the onetime rising star is ascendant once again.\" That is even truer now, with Trump leading the conservative movement. Zuylen-Wood notes that this new era in D'Souza's career has been rather profitable, with both of his documentaries earning tens of millions of dollars, and he is been able to generate sales by targeting enemies perceived to be trying to sabotage him. \"D'Souza has mastered the art of turning perceived slights into commercial gain,\" Zuylen-Wood writes. \"When Costco pulled America the book a few months ago, citing poor sales, D'Souza claimed that he was being targeted for political reasons. Costco's CEO is an Obama fundraiser. An AM radio scandal was born. Costco backed down, restocked the title, and D'Souza's books were suddenly more popular than ever.\" Some of D'Souza's bigger provocations, like the selfie tweet or this one: Obama forcefully asserts his position on Beheading pic.twitter.com QbVbvE582d Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza August 29, 2014 play directly to this new audience. So did his sympathetic position on Donald Trump in the primaries: I am not endorsing anyone, but I do relish the frustration befuddlement of the GOP establishment as Trump wins one more time Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 24, 2016 For his part, D'Souza told Zuylen-Wood that he did not think his approach changed any from when he was an AEI or Hoover fellow: \"What you should do, Simon, is go back and read Illiberal Education and its tone, and then read the America book and its tone. I do not think there is a fundamental difference in my approach then and now Illiberal Education has been baptized into a sort of pathbreaking, sort of sober, responsible book. It was a bomb when I dropped it in 1991!\" D'Souza has a point. He is been provoking people for provocation's sake since he published an interview with a Klan member accompanied by a doctored photo of a black classmate being lynched. Sometimes he will even admit that is what he is doing: Mediaite I love it when my tweets score a direct hit, measured by the intensity of shrieking on the left Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza October 6, 2014 Correction: This post originally referred to World Magazine's editor-in-chief as \"Martin Olasky.\" His first name is Marvin. <doc_sep> Recently pardoned conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza wasted no time before mocking the man who put him away following his full pardon by President Trump on Thursday. \"KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired I got pardoned,\" D'Souza tweeted at Bharara, former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Bharara indicted D'Souza in 2014 for using \"straw donors\" to funnel 20,000 to Wendy Long's 2012 US Senate campaign in New York. D'Souza pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months in a halfway house and five years' probation, along with a 30,000 fine. Trump fired Bharara, appointed by President Barack Obama, after he refused to resign last year. The former prosecutor tweeted earlier Thursday that he stands by the conviction. \"The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job.

President Donald Trump says. Associated Press WASHINGTON AP The Latest on President Donald Trump's consideration of pardons and sentence commutations all times local 12:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says he is considering commuting the sentence of ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and pardoning Martha Stewart. The comments came aboard Air Force One on Thursday after he announced on Twitter that he planned to pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza. Trump tells reporters that Blagojevich said something dumb but that \"lots of politicians\" do and thinks his sentence is excessive. The Democratic former governor began serving his 14-year prison sentence on corruption convictions in 2012. His scheduled release date is 2024. Blagojevich was also a contestant on Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality television show in 2010. Stewart was convicted in 2004 of obstructing justice and lying to the government about why she unloaded stock just before the price plummeted. Trump says she \"used to be one of my biggest fans.\" _ 10:10 a.m. President Donald Trump says he will pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud. Trump tweeted Thursday: \"Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!\" In 2014, D'Souza was sentenced to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a YOU.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.",

First, he announced that he would issue a full pardon to conservative firebrand Dinesh D'Souza, who once pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Hours later came two higher-profile names: Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he might pardon Martha Stewart and free former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich from prison, reports the AP. Details and developments: D'Souza: \"He was treated very unfairly by our government!\" Trump tweeted. In 2014, D'Souza received five years' probation and a 30,000 fine after prosecutors say he used \"straw donors,\" reports the Washington Post. That is, prosecutors say he got people to donate money to the GOP New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in 2012 with the understanding that he would reimburse them. His background: The 57-year-old is a best-selling author and filmmaker who was one of President Obama's most vocal critics. He also went after Hillary Clinton frequently. See this trailer for his Hillary's America for a taste. He has a \"penchant for trolling and needling liberals,\" writes Dylan Matthews in a profile at Vox. D'Souza has long maintained that he was prosecuted because of his politics, and he was gloating publicly at the expense of former US attorney Preet Bharara Thursday, notes the New York Post, which collects the related tweets.",

But the move also marks a return to the mainstream for a man who has long been considered a fringe figure in the conservative movement, writes David Frum at the Washington Post. \"It is a welcome return for someone who, for decades, was a member in good standing of American conservative intellectual life,\" he writes, adding that D",

Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane has already joined the protest, and now linebacker Bobby Wagner and receiver Doug Baldwin may join him. In fact, the entire Seahawks roster may sit in solidarity with the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. Wagner said he did not know if he was going to sit but that, \"anything we want to do, it is not going to be individual. It is going to be a team thing. That is what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals.\" When asked if other players on the team have considered joining Lane's protest, Baldwin said, \"our locker room has discussed it. So we will see.\" Baldwin said he has heard from veterans who have supported a series of tweets he posted defending the protest. He had the following to say about it: \"My grandfather being in the military, it hit home for me as well, and specifically it is the veterans. That is more heartening to me than anything is the veterans that have reached out and said that is what they fought for, that is what they sacrificed their lives for, is to give people back home under the flag, under this country, the opportunity to stand up or sit for what they believe in.\" Baldwin also said he has been in contact with Kaepernick over the last few days. Wagner said the Seahawks organization and coaches will not dictate what the players do. \"We have the freedom to do whatever we want here. Whatever we decide to do, we are not going to get into too much trouble. We are big kids now.\" When it closes in on kickoff at CenturyLink Field on Sunday all eyes will be on the Seahawks to see what they decide to do. <doc_sep> At the very least, Colin Kaepernick's decision to kneel for the national anthem has raised awareness about why he is doing it, which he explained last month: \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" Granted, the issue has been a contentious one, and as President Obama pointed out this week, the way Kaepernick has chosen to deliver is message might be \"messy\" but this is how \"democracy works.\" But Kaepernick also is not alone; over the weekend, United States Women's National Team member Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem prior to her club team's game, and fellow NFL player, Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane did the same. Lane says he will continue to sit and he could have company from teammates. Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin is considering following Lane's lead, while linebacker Bobby Wagner said the team has been talking about taking action as a group. Details via the Seattle Times' Bob Condotta: While Wagner said he did not know if he would sit down during the anthem he said \"anything we want to do, it is not going to be individual. It is going to be a team thing. That is what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals.\" Wagner said he could not say exactly what the team might do, saying \"whatever we decide to do will be a big surprise.\" Meanwhile, Lane has the full support of Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. Lane's pretty clear on what he did and what he was trying to express and I think it is very simple and so we will leave that up to him,\" Carroll said. \"But he understands the responsibility of it, I think, and shouldering it.' Wagner added: \"We have the freedom to do whatever we want here. Whatever we decide to do, we are not going to get into too much trouble. We are big kids now.\" And Baldwin said he did not think there would be any issues in the locker room, even if some players disagreed with the idea of sitting during the anthem. \"It is different in our locker room,\" he explained. \"We kind of give each other a lot of slack, so whatever decisions you make, we understand we are all human beings. Some of us might not agree, some of us will agree. But at the same time we give each other slack because we know we are all human beings.\" One person that will not have a problem with Lane or others: Defensive end Michael Bennett. \"I mean I think it is his right to be able to protest,\" Bennett said last week, when Lane first made his stance by sitting. \"And I think it is all right. I think there are definitely some issues in America that a lot of people are starting to recognize. I think people have recognized them before but I think with social media and the things that are going on out there, the media outlets, everybody has a chance to really show what is going on and their ideas and having a chance to really protest what they think is wrong with America and that is OK, that is what it is about.

    "document": "Moe's Southwest Grill has toppled Chipotle to become America's favorite Mexican-inspired fast casual restaurant chain, according to a new poll. The 1,900-unit Chipotle Mexican Grill chain, which had topped the last three annual Harris polls, did not even finish in the top four. The Denver-based chain has been beset by a number of food-borne illnesses in the last year, including a norovirus outbreak that sickened 386 customers, a salmonella incident that sickened 64 people and e. coli episodes in 11 states that sickened 60 people. As a result, sales have decline 30 percent and the company's shares have dipped 33 percent, to 411.14, in early Friday trading. For Moe's, a 600-unit chain, the first place finish in the Harris poll was its first. Moe's showed the largest increase in brand equity 13 percent among all restaurants measured, and demonstrates one of the largest equity increases across all brands assessed, which is significant given the tendency for equity to resist rapid movement. If getting knocked out of the top position was not bad enough for Chipotle executives, then the names of the chains that Americans love more than Chipotle should give them pause: Taco Bell finshed No. 2 in the poll, with Qdoba Mexican Grill coming in third and Baja Fresh Mexican Grill coming in fourth. Harris polled 97,120 US consumers aged 15 and over. <doc_sep> Chipotle Mexican Grill has had a tumultuous year between the bouts of food-borne illnesses and plummeting sales, but it has managed to emerge from the mess of E. coli-related issues. But the pile-on continues as other chains take advantage of the shifting fast-casual market food and begin to climb past the Denver-based chain in customer ratings. Moe's Southwest Grill, which got its start in Atlanta in 2000 and now has more than 600 locations worldwide, is reaping significant benefits from Chipotle's downturn. The chain has been named \"brand of the year\" in the Harris Poll's category of fast-casual Mexican restaurants, unseating Chipotle, which took the top prize for the last three years but failed to even make the top four in 2016. This year, Chipotle was bested by Taco Bell, Qdoba Mexican Grill, and Baja Fresh Mexican Grill. The Harris Poll ranked this year's brands based on more than 97,000 responses from United States customers, and Moe's was praised for its willingness to listen and respond to diner feedback and needs. \"We really view the competition as share of stomach,\" Moe's president Bruce Schroder said previously. Moe's is part of Focus Brands Inc., which operates chains such as Carvel, Cinnabon, and Auntie Anne's Pretzels, among others. On February 8, when Chipotle closed all of its restaurants for a food safety self-check, Moe's took out a full-page ad in USA Today to emphasize its openness. Overall, Moe's has seen a 5 percent increase in foot traffic thanks in part to Chipotle's struggles, according to a Placed survey. Chipotle still has some loyalists, however, such as the Washington man who is working toward his goal of eating a meal from the chain 366 days in a row. <doc_sep> CLOSE Harris Poll named Moe's the Brand of the Year for fast casual Mexican restaurants, ending Chipotle's three year run as their 1 chain. Moe's Southwest Grill has unseated Chipotle as fast casual Mexican restaurant \"Brand of the Year,\" according to an annual Harris Poll. Photo: Moe's Southwest Grill People with a hankering for a burrito are no longer beelining for Chipotle first. Or second, or third, or fourth. Moe's Southwest Grill, a Tex-Mex chain with less than half the number of locations as Chipotle, has unseated the former fast casual king as the most popular brand selling Mexican-inspired food, according to an annual survey out Thursday from Harris Poll that measures how people feel about restaurant brands. Moe's has more than 650 restaurants to Chipotle's more than 1,900. Moe's, which is owned by the same company that operates shopping mall mainstays Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon, claimed the \"Brand of the Year\" title for fast casual Mexican restaurants for the first time, while Chipotle fell hard. The No. 1 pick for the past three years, it is now ranked below not only Moe's but Taco Bell, Qdoba and Baja Fresh. The survey is yet another sign of the harsh impact Chipotle's food-safety issues have had on the brand in the past year. Chipotle has been grasping at a former semblance of its reputation as a purveyor of fresh food in the months since dealing with multiple incidences of E. Coli and norovirus at restaurants across the country. Sales tanked, a rude awakening for a brand that had been wildly popularity for years. The company has said customers are coming back around though, and has tried to lure customers back with offers for free burritos and buy one, get one deals. In the first quarter, sales at stores open at least a year fell nearly 30 though the company said transaction volume improved as the quarter went on. A free burrito offer in February had a 67 redemption rate. But beyond Chipotle's issues, the fast casual restaurant landscape has also become more competitive as chains have gone head to head to offer customers healthier food and new menu options. Qdoba rolled out a new taco menu last year with fillings like tequila lime chicken, steak and bacon; Taco Bell has gained prominence for its breakfast menu and started selling alcohol in some restaurants last year. Moe's is known for a wide selection of ingredients for build-your-own tacos, quesadillas and burrito bowls the brand also frequently offers limited time menu additions, such as an ancho chili lime rice bowl and seasonal salsas like ghost pepper and mango tomatillo. Chipotle, meanwhile, has rarely introduced new menu items, and some say the company has not done enough to show customers its food is safe to eat, even though it has adopted new food safety protocols. \"Their sales have been under tremendous pressure,\" says Andrew Charles, an equity research analyst with Cowen and Co. who follows both Chipotle and Qdoba. \"Brand perception is down. In retrospect, I just do not think they did enough to convince customers that Chipotle food was safe to eat,\" pointing out that there are no signs in stores alerting customers to the changes and announcements on social media have been scarce. Moe's rose to the top for ranking the highest in familiarity, quality and purchase consideration. Harris Poll surveyed more than 97,000 YOU.S. consumers for their thoughts on more than 3,800 brands, including more than 60 restaurants. Each respondent was given a list of 40 randomly selected brands to rate. Moe's has benefited from a rapid expansion in recent years, which has given the brand a stronger position as a Chipotle alternative, says Lisa Recoussine, vice president of client services at Nielsen, which owns Harris Poll. Moe's opened 70 new restaurants last year, when sales hit nearly 640 million. To be sure, Chipotle still has much larger market share and sales, which were 4.5 billion in 2015. According to Placed Insights, an analytics firm that measures traffic trends, just 2.3 of the YOU.S. population visited a Moe's last month, while nearly 9.4 visited a Chipotle. Though the poll results show Moe's may be poised to steal more customers, says David Shim, CEO of Placed Insights. \"Moe's has an opportunity to continue to convert that brand equity into restaurant visits,\" Shim says, \"closing the visitation gap with Chipotle.\" Read or Share this story: http: usat.ly 1tdDDKc",

Competition in the category has been fierce, with Mexican eateries all trying to one-up each other in serving up healthier menu items with more selection. USA Today notes that Moe's is especially known for the ample variety of ingredients used to create build-your-own tacos, burritos, and other fare. But it is almost as if Chipotle gave up, debuting few new menu items and taking a halfhearted approach to alerting consumers to steps it is taken to address the hundreds of illnesses-the New York Post helpfully documents the norovirus, E. coli, and salmonella count-that have resulted from chowing down its food. \"I just do not think they did enough to convince customers that Chipotle food was safe to eat,\" an equity research analyst tells USA Today. Plus, Moe's made sure to capitalize on Chipotle's woes, taking out a full-page ad in USA Today on February 8, for instance, reminding everyone its restaurants were open-Chipotle shut down that day to review food-safety protocol with staff, Eater notes. \"Moe's now has an opportunity to continue to convert that brand equity into restaurant visits, closing the visitation gap with Chipotle,\" the CEO of analytics company Placed Insights tells USA Today.

So the new Donald Trump kind of surprised me.\" Stern said he does not believe Trump has had a change of heart on issues like abortion, but is instead playing to his base. The radio host said he also believed Trump ran for president solely to get a larger contract from NBC for \"The Apprentice.\" \"I think it started out as like a kind of cool, fun thing to do in order to get a couple more bucks out of NBC for The Apprentice, I actually do believe that,\" Stern said. \"He just wanted a couple more bucks out of NBC, and that is why Donald is calling for voter fraud investigations.

    "document": "JOHNS CREEK, Ga. A promising start turned into a shocking disappointment Thursday for Tiger Woods, who made three double bogeys at Atlanta Athletic Club on his way to a 77 during the first round of the PGA Championship. Tiger Woods shared the lead at 3-under early Thursday, then struggled to a 77. Daniel Shirey US Presswire The 7-over-par total left Woods tied for 129th place, well behind first-round leader Steve Stricker, who shot a 63, matching a major championship record. For Woods, who has won 14 major titles, it was among his worst performances. \"I am not down, I am just very angry right now,\" Woods said after shooting his highest opening round in a major championship and highest ever at the PGA. \"I thought I could play by feel, see the shot, hit the shot. I am not at that point yet.\" Woods started nicely Thursday morning, rolling in a birdie putt at the 10th hole his first then adding birdies at the 12th and 14th holes. At 3-under par through his first five holes, Woods was tied for the early lead. But he lost five shots against par on the next four holes, with double bogeys at the 15th and 18th. Tiger added five more bogeys on the front nine, including his third double bogey of the day, at No. 6. Woods, who tees off at 1:45 p.m. ET on Friday, is now in danger of seeing his PGA Tour season come to an early end. Woods has never missed the cut in 13 previous PGA Championships, but if he fails to finish among the top 70 and ties, he will be headed home for the weekend. And that means he might not be seen again this year on the PGA Tour. Woods, 35, is 129th in FedEx Cup points and needs to be among the top 125 through next week's Wyndham Championship in order to advance to the first of four playoff events in two weeks. <doc_sep> Tiger Woods staggers to an opening 77 at PGA Championship JOHNS CREEK, Ga. One hour after he started, Tiger Woods was atop the leaderboard Thursday at the PGA Championship and felt like the Tiger of old. He never imagined he would end up with his worst score ever in the opening round of a major. He opened with three birdies in five holes. He followed with three double bogeys over the next 10 holes. Woods started out with his name high on the board, right next to Steve Stricker, who went on to tie a major championship record with 63. He wound up toward the bottom, next to John Daly and 57-year-old Jerry Pate, with a 77. It was his highest round in a major since Woods shot an 81 in the vicious wind and pelting rain of Muirfield in the third round of the British Open nine years ago. And it was no mystery to him how it all happened. \"Got off to a great start today, was 3 under early, was having mechanical thoughts through those holes and I thought, 'I can let it go' and play by instinct and feel,\" he said. \"And it just screwed up my whole round. I am not at that point where I can do that yet.\" Woods returned to competition last week and completed his first tournament since the Masters, staying away from golf until he was certain that injuries to his left leg would no longer because him trouble. The head not to mention his swing still have plenty of work. Looking serious as ever when he walked onto the putting green to begin warming up, dressed in a deep coral shirt and blank pants, close to a Sunday look. Then came an 18-foot birdie putt on the opening hole, No. 10, an aggressive 5-wood from a blind shot in the pine straw on the par-5 12th, followed by a bunker shot from a plugged lie to 3 feet for another birdie. He hammered a drive more than 300 yards in the air on the 14th, leaving him a wedge to 3 feet for another birdie. \"He is back!\" a fan cried out from behind the green as Woods approached. Not quite. It was the highest opening round for Woods in any tournament since he shot 79 at the Australian Open in 1996. He is due to play Down Under again in November. At this rate, that might be his next tournament. Not since the final round at Bay Hill in 2007 had Woods made at least three double bogeys in one round. He started this carnage with a 4-iron on the 254-yard 15th hole that did not look awful until it landed, just to the right of the green and into the pond. On the 18th, his tee shot flew into the bunker with such force that it buried into the side of the sand, and he did well to get it out sideways to the fairway. But he missed his target by some 30 yards on the next shot, into another bunker, and took another double bogey. His final double bogey came from a fairway bunker at No. 6, a shot he knew was bad as soon as he hit it. It landed in the middle of the pound, and then it was a matter of limiting the damage. He finished with a bogey from the bunker. Woods was in the sand a dozen times. He has talked about going back to his old swing while trying to learn a new one, and he said that was the case Thursday. \"And that is what is frustrating,\" Woods said. \"I thought I was playing well enough that I do not have to do that. I can just go out and there play and let it go and just play by feel see the shot, hit the shot, feel it. And I am not at that point yet. My same motor patterns get in there. I start fighting it and I could not get it back.\" Woods might not have much time left. He is No. 129 in the standings for the FedEx Cup playoffs that start in two weeks. If he misses the cut Friday he has only done that twice in the majors he would not be eligible for any PGA Tour events for six weeks.

Associated Press Republican YOU.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore talks to the media as he arrives to vote, Tuesday, December 12, 2017, in Gallant, Ala. Alabama voters are deciding between Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and Democrat Doug Jones. AP Photo Brynn Anderson Associated Press BIRMINGHAM, Ala. AP The Latest on Alabama's YOU.S. Senate election all times local 9:24 p.m. CST Democrat Doug Jones has won election to the YOU.S. Senate from Alabama, dealing a political blow to President Donald Trump. Jones has defeated Republican Roy Moore, a one-time GOP pariah who was embraced by the Republican Party and the president even after facing allegations of sexual impropriety. An attorney and former prosecutor, Jones rallied voters on a message of moving past the Moore controversies. He was buoyed by an influx of national Democratic cash and endorsements. Jones' victory is set to narrow the slim Republican majority over Democrats in the Senate to 51-49. His win in the Republican stronghold energizes the Democratic Party as it looks to build on anti-Trump sentiment to mount a challenge next year to Republican control of Congress. _ 8:40 p.m. Republican Roy Moore has briefly greeted an optimistic crowd at his election night party in Montgomery, Alabama. Moore shook hands with supporters after they chanted, \"Judge Roy Moore.\" He then left to watch returns in another room. His campaign manager told the crowd that Moore would soon have the new title of senator. With about half the vote counted, the Alabama Senate race between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones is too close to call. Moore is looking for support in rural areas and party loyalty from Republicans to carry him to victory. Jones is attempting to become the first Alabama Democrat elected to the YOU.S. Senate in 25 years. _ 7:10 p.m. Republican Roy Moore's supporters are expressing optimism as polls close in Alabama. Supporters filed into Moore's election night party in Montgomery shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. \"Watch party? It is a victory party,\" Moore campaign manager Rich Hobson told the crowd. Becky Gerritson, the leader of a nearby tea party group, says sexual misconduct allegations against Moore have caused his supporters to rally around him harder. \"We are seeing his supporters digging in and they are pumped up,\" Gerritson said. Reporters at Moore's election night party were kept behind a barricade in the back of the ballroom. _ 7 p.m. Polls are closed in Alabama in the race to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At time of national reckoning over long-suppressed misconduct by powerful men, the choice between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones has taken on outsized significance. Moore has faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers, dividing the GOP and giving Democrats hope of picking up a seat in a reliably red state. President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee broke with top congressional leaders in standing by Moore despite the accusations, wagering that maintaining the seat in the Republican stronghold was of paramount importance. Democrats are hoping to break their 0-5 streak in special elections for Republican-held seats in 2017, and looking for momentum heading into the 2018 midterm elections. _ 4:30 p.m. Alabama Republican Roy Moore's campaign says The Washington Post is not being let into his election night gathering in Montgomery. The Post first reported the allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore. Moore campaign spokeswoman Hannah Ford confirmed the newspaper is not being granted press credentials. The campaign told the newspaper it had reviewed its request and was denying them. Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in Tuesday's election for a YOU.S. Senate seat. _ 3:45 p.m. There are signs of heightened security at Republican Roy Moore's election night gathering in the Alabama race for YOU.S. Senate. Men in SWAT uniforms videoed the exterior of the building where Moore's party is being held in Montgomery. Campaign spokeswoman Hannah Ford said the campaign had previously received threats. Earlier Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security official said the agency is keeping an eye on the election. The agency's top infrastructure and cybersecurity official said a federal protective security adviser and a cybersecurity adviser are in Montgomery and working \"side by side\" with state government officials in case issues arise. _ 2 p.m. The Department of Homeland Security is keeping its eye on Alabama's special YOU.S. Senate election. The agency's top infrastructure and cybersecurity official says a federal protective security adviser and a cybersecurity adviser are in the capital city of Montgomery and working \"side by side\" with state government officials in case issues arise. Christopher Krebs says he is not aware of any specific threats. But he says DHS has been working with the state \"for quite some time\" to prepare for any issues. It is part of a larger effort to better share threat information and provide technical support after DHS concluded Russian government hackers targeted election systems in 21 states last year. Krebs says: \"We learned our lessons last year.\" _ 1:55 p.m. Voter turnout appears heavier than expected in one of Alabama's most reliably Republican counties in the YOU.S. Senate election, and officials say they are not just seeing the usual GOP crowd. Shelby County Probate Judge Jim Fuhrmeister says turnout appears higher than normal among young people and black voters in Tuesday's balloting. That could help Democrat Doug Jones against Republican Roy Moore. Democrats have a table outside one of the county's largest voting precincts in Helena, and volunteers from the Jones campaign are canvassing neighborhoods in normally Republican areas. Fuhrmeister says he is not predicting a Democratic win, but he expects the party to see some results for its efforts. Shelby County, just south of Birmingham, is one of Alabama's most affluent counties. _ 11:50 a.m. Republican candidate Roy Moore rode his horse to the polls as he is done in past elections to cast his ballot in the YOU.S. Senate race. Moore was accompanied by his wife Kayla Moore, also on horseback, as he voted at a rural fire station in the northeast Alabama community of Gallant on Tuesday. Dozens of members of the media surrounded the couple, making it difficult for them to get through on their horses. Moore spoke briefly to reporters, talking in generalities and not discussing allegations that he sexually molested teenage girls decades ago. Moore expressed confidence that he will win. He also said that after the election will be the time to discuss whether he is allowed to take a seat in the Senate. _ 11:15 a.m. YOU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he cast an absentee ballot in Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama but declined to specify his choice, saying he \"valued the sanctity of the ballot.\" At a Tuesday news conference in Baltimore on gang violence and immigration, Sessions said Alabama residents are \"good and decent and wonderful\" people. He said he is confident they will make the right decision. Alabama voters are deciding between Republican Roy Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, and Democrat Doug Jones, a lawyer who prosecuted two Ku Klux Klansmen who killed four black girls in a 1963 church bombing. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denies the accusations. The winner of Tuesday's election will take the seat previously held by Sessions. _ 8:55 a.m. Democratic nominee Doug Jones was met by cheering supporters as he cast his ballot in Alabama's YOU.S. Senate race. Jones smiled and waved as he arrived at his voting precinct in the wealthy Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook on Tuesday. Poll workers at the church where he voted complained that so many news reporters were on hand that voters were having a hard time parking. Jones says he feels good about the campaign he is run and he does not think Republican Roy Moore is going to win. Jones said, \"This is an important time in Alabama's history, and we feel very confident where we are and how this is going to turn out.\" _ 8:25 a.m. Alabama's top election official estimates that turnout for the hotly contested YOU.S. Senate election now underway will likely be around 18 to 20 percent of registered voters. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill tells The Associated Press there is also a chance that turnout for the special election could be as high as 25 percent. Voting places opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will remain open until 7 p.m. Cool temperatures were common across Alabama when voting began and the state is expected to see dry weather all day during voting. Republican Roy Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in Tuesday's election. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is now 70 and denies the charges. _ 7:45 a.m. More than two dozen people stood in line in the chilly morning air at Legion Field, a predominantly black precinct in Birmingham, after polls opened at 7 a.m. Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones have both reached out to minority voters during their contentious campaign for a YOU.S. Senate seat. Political observers believe that Jones needs heavy turnout among African-American voters in order to win on Tuesday. The Legion Field precinct is in a stadium office, where blue-tinted posters of local college football players and cheerleaders lined one of the walls. About 20 Doug Jones campaign signs were planted in the ground near the parking lot where voters were driving in to vote. There were no Roy Moore signs. _ 7 a.m. Polls have opened across Alabama in the state's closely watched YOU.S. Senate election, which has drawn national attention. Voting places opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will remain open until 7 p.m. Cool temperatures were common across Alabama shortly before voting began and the state is expected to see dry weather all day during Tuesday's voting. Republican Roy Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in Tuesday's election. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teen girls when he was in his 30s.

The controversies surrounding Republican Roy Moore give Democrat Doug Jones an opening in the GOP-dominated state. Polls open Tuesday morning. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is now 70 and denies the charges. He is telling voters they know his character already. Jones is saying decency must prevail. He is urging Alabama voters to see the race as a crossroads with an opportunity to avoid repeating past mistakes that harm the state's image.

    "document": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Nazis ran death camps in Poland during the brutal 1939-45 occupation Poland has summoned the US ambassador and demanded an apology over comments on the Holocaust by FBI director James Comey. The foreign ministry said Mr Comey had suggested in a Washington Post article that some Poles were accomplices. After the summons US envoy Stephen Mull said he made it clear the US believed \"Nazi Germany alone\" was responsible. Six million Polish citizens were killed by the Nazis during World War Two, half of them Jewish. 'Falsification of history' In the Washington Post article on Thursday, aimed at raising education about the Holocaust, Mr Comey wrote: \"In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. \"They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.\" The words sparked a storm of protest in Poland. Image copyright AFP Image caption James Comey made the comments in a Washington Post article on Thursday President Bronislaw Komorowski told Polish television the comments were an \"insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews\". Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said: \"To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War Two. I would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter.\" Ambassador Mull, who on Sunday attended ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising against the Nazis, said that any suggestion that \"Poland, or any other countries other than Nazi Germany, bear responsibility for the Holocaust, is a mistake, harmful and insulting\". After Sunday's summons he added: \"I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. \"Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility. I now have a lot of work before me to make things right in this situation.\" But Mr Mull also said he believed the wider message of the article was that many people had either aided the Nazis or not done enough in response to the atrocities, including in the US. The Washington Post on Sunday published a column criticising Mr Comey's comments. The Nazis ran death camps in Poland during the brutal 1939-45 occupation. Correction 20 April 2015: In an earlier version of this report, comments made by the Polish ambassador to Washington were incorrectly attributed to Stephen Mull. <doc_sep> FBI Director James Comey Cliff Owen Associated Press The Polish ambassador to Washington has protested, the Polish president has protested, the speaker of the Polish parliament to whom I am married has protested and the YOU.S. ambassador to Warsaw has apologized profusely. Why? Because James Comey, the director of the FBI, in a speech that was reprinted in The Post arguing for more Holocaust education, demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself. In two poorly worded sentences, he sounded to Polish readers as if he were repeating the World War II myth that most drives them crazy: Namely, that somehow, those who lived in occupied Eastern Europe shared full responsibility for a German policy. Comey put it like this: \"In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.\" There are a number of problems with that pair of weak sentences, starting with the vast difference between Germany and the rest. During the war, Germany had a state policy of exterminating the Jews. This policy involved not \"accomplices\" but hundreds of bureaucrats, tens of thousands of soldiers, train schedules and plans. Germany also encouraged the creation of collaborationist governments in other countries Vichy France, for example some of which used their own police officers to send their Jewish citizens into the German death camps. Germany also occupied Poland, but there was no Polish \"Vichy.\" During the war, there was no Polish state at all. Indeed, it was the absence of the Polish state that enabled the Germans to create a lawless, violent world, one in which anyone could be arbitrarily murdered, any Jew could be deported and any Pole who helped a Jew could be shot instantly, along with his entire family. Many were. Millions of others died too Polish intellectuals, priests and politicians were all Nazi targets. In the course of the war, most of Poland's infrastructure, industry and architecture were destroyed. In that atmosphere, many people were frightened by or indifferent to the fate of the Jews, and some murdered in order to avoid being murdered. But that does not mean that \"in their minds\" they \"did not do something evil.\" Although the circumstances were different, Germany's leading role is equally clear in Hungary. The wartime government of Adm. Mikls Horthy did pass anti-Semitic legislation and did align itself with the Nazis. But the mass murder and deportation of the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz began only in March 1944, when that government dissolved and was replaced with a straightforward German occupation. Once the Hungarian state had been dissolved, in other words, Hungary also became a lawless, violent zone where anything was possible. So no, it is not true, as Comey made it sound, that \"murderers and accomplices\" in Germany, Poland and Hungary and lots of other places were somehow responsible for the Holocaust. And no, it is not true that the Holocaust is a story of so many otherwise \"good\" people who \"convinced themselves it was the right thing to do.\" On the contrary, it is a story about the power of fear, the danger of lawlessness and the horror that was made possible by a specific form of German state terror in the years between 1939 and 1945 a terror that convinced many people to do things that they knew were terribly, terribly wrong. If the FBI director wants to take some lessons from Washington's excellent Holocaust museum, that is very admirable. But first he should make sure he is understood what he is seen. <doc_sep> Visitors to the United States Holocaust Museum pass beneath a cast taken from the original entrance to the Auschwitz death camp, inscribed with the phrase Arbeit Macht Frei Work Makes One Free Bill O'Leary WASHINGTON POST The writer is director of the FBI. This commentary is adapted from a speech given Wednesday at the YOU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's 2015 National Tribute Dinner. I believe that the Holocaust is the most significant event in human history. And I mean \"significant\" in two different ways. It is, of course, significant because it was the most horrific display in world history of inhumanity, one that simply defies words and challenges meaning. I was born into an Irish Catholic family in this great, wonderful and safe country, but the Holocaust has always haunted me, and it has long stood as a stumbling block to faith. How could such a thing be? How is that consistent with the concept of a loving God? How is that in any way reconcilable with the notion of a God with a role in human history? How could there possibly be meaning in life, when so many lives were snuffed out in such a fashion? I have asked those questions since I was a young teenager. I have asked them my entire life. I asked the same questions standing in the pit at Ground Zero in early 2002. I have asked those questions many times as I have confronted unimaginable suffering and loss. And I know I am in good company asking such questions. Last month, on a flight home from Eastern Europe, I reread Viktor Frankl's wrenching \"Man's Search for Meaning,\" in which he seeks to find meaning in suffering and loving, among other things. And going much farther back, back before I was a religious studies major in college, I recalled the voice from the whirlwind in the Book of Job, rebuking us for even asking the question \"Why?\" \"How dare you!\" the voice seems to say. \"It is not for you to ask, it is not for you to know.\" And yet I ask, as so many of us do. And I still do not know. But I do know this: I know it is our duty, our obligation, to make sure some good comes from unimaginable bad. Not so we can comfort ourselves by saying, \"Oh, that was worth it then.\" That is nonsense. That would be perverse. It will never be \"worth it.\" Instead, I believe it is simply our duty to do that, and I believe this is truth no matter where you come from on a philosophical or religious spectrum. Our obligation is to refuse to let bad win, to refuse to let evil hold the field. As Abraham Lincoln said on a field of unimaginable pain and loss, it is essential \"that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\" Our resolution does not justify the loss, but we simply cannot be alive and give up. There are so many ways to fight evil to ensure it does not hold the field. Some do this through public service that can involve actual physical battles against evil; others by different kinds of service, including the service of teaching a world what happened, teaching a world what is true. The Holocaust was, as I said, the most horrific display in world history of inhumanity. But it was also the most horrific display in world history of our humanity, of our capacity for evil and for moral surrender. And that second significance is the reason I require every new FBI special agent and intelligence analyst to go to the Holocaust Museum. Naturally, I want them to learn about abuse of authority on a breathtaking scale. But I want them to confront something more painful and more dangerous: I want them to see humanity and what we are capable of. I want them to see that, although this slaughter was led by sick and evil people, those sick and evil leaders were joined by, and followed by, people who loved their families, took soup to a sick neighbor, went to church and gave to charity. Good people helped murder millions. And that is the most frightening lesson of all that our very humanity made us capable of, even susceptible to, surrendering our individual moral authority to the group, where it can be hijacked by evil. Of being so cowed by those in power. Of convincing ourselves of nearly anything. In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That is what people do. And that should truly frighten us. That is why I send our agents and our analysts to the Holocaust Museum. I want them to stare at us and realize our capacity for rationalization and moral surrender. I want them to walk out of that great museum treasuring the constraint and oversight of divided government, the restriction of the rule of law, the binding of a free and vibrant press. I want them to understand that all of this is necessary as a check on us because of the way we are. We must build it, we must know it and we must nurture it now, so that it can save us later. That is the only path to the responsible exercise of power.",

In another Washington Post column, Anne Applebaum writes that it is wrong to call Poles \"accomplices\" because after the 1939 invasion of Poland, it was Germans who created \"a lawless, violent world, one in which anyone could be arbitrarily murdered, any Jew could be deported-and any Pole who helped a Jew could be shot instantly, along with his entire family.

    "document": "Almost three days to the minute after he lost a High Court bid to overturn a conviction against him, self-styled sheikh Man Haron Monis took 17 people hostage in the heart of Sydney's legal precinct. Shortly before 9.50am last Friday, the court had dealt a blow to Monis' long-running legal battle to overturn his conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. At 9.45am on Monday, police were called to an unfolding siege at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place, metres from the Law Courts Building in Phillip Street where Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler had refused an application by Monis to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him. Monis was dead just under 17 hours later. So too were two hostages who were taken to hospital after an exchange of gunfire at the cafe just after 2am on Tuesday. Monis had been consumed by the fight over his conviction for sending the offensive letters. Advertisement \"This pen is my gun, and these words are my bullets,\" he had said outside a Sydney court after he was charged over the letters. \"I will fight with these weapons against oppression to promote peace.\" In August last year, he had reluctantly pleaded guilty to using a postal service to send the \"harassing or offensive\" letters to the grieving families of the soldiers as well as the family of an Austrade official killed in Indonesia. But this was not before he fought the validity of the charges all the way to the High Court, arguing the offence in the Criminal Code infringed the implied freedom of communication on political and governmental matters in the Commonwealth constitution. Monis claimed the letters were his own version of a \"condolence card\" or \"flower basket\" and he only sought to persuade the families to oppose Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan. When the High Court handed down its ruling in February last year, it was split three-three on the issue and so it was bound to uphold an earlier, unanimous, decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal that the charges against him were constitutionally valid. Chief Justice French and Justices Kenneth Hayne and Dyson Heydon would have ruled in Monis' favour but Justices Susan Crennan, Susan Kiefel and Virginia Bell would have dismissed his case. When Monis lost that battle, and had to stand trial for the offences, he pleaded guilty to all 12 charges against him. He escaped a prison sentence the maximum penalty is two years behind bars and was sentenced instead to 300 hours of community service and placed on a good behaviour bond for the \"offensive and deplorable letters\". His co-accused and girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting him. But Monis fought on. On Friday, the 50-year-old's legal team, led by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds, SC, asked the High Court to hear the constitutional issue again because the court had been split down the middle on the issue. \"Here, of course, there are special circumstances because of the three-three split,\" Mr Reynolds told the court shortly after it convened in Sydney at 9.30am. Mr Reynolds argued that an even split meant \"no principle or precedent\" was established in the earlier case brought on Monis' behalf in the High Court. \"If it was four-three, I would be in the position of having a precedent against me,\" Mr Reynolds said. Chief Justice French and Justice Gageler were not persuaded. \"In our opinion it suffices to say that, having regard to the history of the matter, we do not think it appropriate to make the order sought to hear the case The application will be dismissed,\" Chief Justice French said. Monis heard the result of the case late on Friday, and took a gun into Martin Place on Monday. It is an irony that Monis was incensed by a conviction that resulted in a mere 300 hours of community service. At the time of the siege, he was on bail in relation to two separate and serious cases that could have seen him imprisoned for decades. He was charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact to the murder of his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed and set alight in a Werrington apartment block. Droudis has been charged with the murder. And this year, Monis was charged by sex crimes squad detectives with more than 40 indecent and sexual assault charges relating to his time spent as a self-proclaimed \"spiritual healer\". <doc_sep> Monis had conviction for sending offensive letters to relatives of Australian victims of terrorism and troops killed in Afghanistan Until his entry into the global media spotlight as the shadowy figure at the centre of the Sydney siege, Man Haron Monis had long been viewed as a fringe figure in Sydney's Islamic community, his self-radicalisation rooted in grievances against the Australian government and increasing marginalisation among his peers. The self-proclaimed spiritual healer had achieved a degree of notoriety as the author of \"grossly offensive\" letters sent to taunt parents and relatives of Australians killed by extremism in Indonesia as well as troops who lost their lives in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009. Well known to the Australian police, he had been consumed by his conviction for the offence, unsuccessfully challenging the conviction in the high court last year and making several vehement and erratic public statements claiming to be innocent. Monis lost another bid to have the matter heard before the high court on Friday. He also faced numerous charges relating to his time working as a \"spiritual healer\" including 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault and had been bailed for allegedly being an accessory to the killing of his former wife. When Monis, who was also known as Mohammad Hassan Manteghi, appeared in court in October over the sex assault allegations, police charged him with 40 additional offences. It was alleged that he had advised a 27-year-old woman to visit him at his business in Wentworthville in 2002 after she contacted him through a \"Spiritual Consultation\" ad in a community newspaper. He was charged last year with being an accessory to the murder of his 30-year-old former wife Noleen Hayson Pal, a mother-of-two who was allegedly stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013. Iranian-born, Monis sought asylum in Australia in 1996, telling ABC News in 2001 he fled after falling foul of the Iranian regime, which he said had placed his wife and children under house arrest. \"I can say they are hostage,\" he said at the time, having reportedly given himself the title Sheikh Haron. As recently as last week on a website he used both to defend and promote himself, he announced that he had converted from Shia to Sunni Islam and pledged his allegiance to the caliphate declared by the militant group Islamic State. That website was shut down as Monday's siege developed, and police asked media outlets to refrain from giving him a platform as he held 17 hostages in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place. Sydney Shia leaders had apparently urged federal police to probe his claim to be a leading cleric, while he was ignored by the Sunni community. He had no links to the Islamic State terrorist group, and despite his criminal past was not seen as a likely exponent of the group's ideology. One upshot, some would argue, is that he fits bill of a classic lone wolf a profile that had been much feared by security officials. Monis is believed to have been a self-starter, who had attached himself to the virulent worldview of Isis. His self-radicalisation appeared to be rooted in grievances against the government and fueled by his increasing marginalisation. Earlier this month, Monis had posted on his website that Shia muslims were rejectionists a key message of extremist Sunnis in the Middle East. But there were other hints on the web post that Monis had become radicalised: a rambling October letter he penned to the Muslim community rejected the \"new religion\" of moderate Islam. 'This pen is my gun and these words are my bullets, I fight by these weapons against oppression to promote peace,' he wrote. An image on the website appears to show Monis wearing the same headband that photographs suggest he donned during the Martin Place siege, reading: \"We are ready to sacrifice for you, O Muhammad.\" Shortly after Tony Abbott's government was elected in September last year, Monis sent the prime minister a letter inviting him to a live debate in which he said he would prove that \"Australia and Australians will be attacked\" as a result of the country's participation in the war in Afghanistan. Manny Conditsis, a lawyer who represented Monis at one point, has decribed his former client as an isolated figure who might have felt that he had nothing to lose, \"hence participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this\". \"His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,\" Conditsis told ABC news. <doc_sep> Sydney siege: Man behind Martin Place stand-off was Iranian Man Haron Monis, who had violent criminal history Updated The gunman killed during the siege at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place was an Iranian cleric with a violent criminal past. Man Haron Monis, who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001, was on bail for a string of violent offences, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He was also facing more than 50 sexual and indecent assault charges and had a conviction for sending abusive letters to families of deceased Australian soldiers. Police negotiated with Monis, via hostages, for 16 hours on Monday before officers stormed the building at 2:00am AEDT on Tuesday. He entered the cafe about 9:45am AEDT on Monday and held 17 staff and customers inside throughout the day. Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed more about Monis' background in his press briefing this morning. What we do know is that the perpetrator was well known to State and Commonwealth authorities. He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. We know that he sent offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was found guilty of offences related to this. We also know that he posted graphic extremist material online. As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult. His former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the ABC that Monis was an isolated figure who had acted alone. Do you know more about this story? Email investigations abc.net.au. \"He came to Australia in the late 1990s as I understand it, obtained political asylum in 2001. He fled Iran because he was in fear of his life from the regime at that time,\" Mr Conditsis told ABC News Breakfast. \"Monis personally faced charges as a result of writing letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers. \"They were dealt with in 2013. Subsequent to that he was charged with accessory before and after the fact in relation to the murder of his former spouse. Eventually he got bail. \"I appeared for him in December of 2013 when he obtained bail essentially based on a case that was presented by the prosecution at the time. It had significant weaknesses in it. I think that had a significant impact on him getting bail at that time.\" More recently, he was charged with more than 50 allegations of indecent and sexual assault. Police allege the assaults took place in 2002, when Monis was a self-proclaimed \"spiritual healer\" operating out of premises in Wentworthville. It is alleged that Monis placed ads in local newspapers offering \"spiritual consultation\". He claimed to be an expert in astrology, numerology, meditation and black magic. But it was Monis' ongoing legal battle over his conviction for sending offensive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers between 2007 and 2009 that may have tipped him over the edge. The siege followed an unsuccessful, last-ditch attempt in the High Court to have the charges overturned. Monis was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and placed on a two-year good behaviour bond for the \"offensive and deplorable letters\" sent with the help of his girlfriend Amirah Droudis. They were sent to the families of Private Luke Worsley and Lance Corporal Jason Marks, who were killed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. He also sent a letter in 2009 to the family of the Austrade official Craig Senger, who was killed in the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2007. Monis claimed the letters were his own version of a \"flower basket\" or \"condolence card\". He challenged the validity of the charges in the High Court, arguing they were political. But he lost and at trial, pleaded guilty to all 12 charges against him in August 2013. Mr Conditsis represented Monis last year when he was charged with being accessory to the murder of ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed and set alight outside a western Sydney unit. \"Knowing he was on bail for very serious offences, knowing that while he was in custody some terrible things happened to him, I thought he may consider that he is got nothing to lose,\" he said. \"Hence participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He said Monis claimed to have suffered poor treatment while in prison. \"He was put through let us say some very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" he said. Mr Conditsis said the public could be assured the siege was not the work of an organised terrorist group. \"This was a one-off random individual,\" he said. \"It was not a concerted terrorism event or act. \"It was a damaged-goods individual who did something outrageous.\" Topics: islam, religion-and-beliefs, community-and-society, law-crime-and-justice, sydney-2000 First posted <doc_sep> Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Australian PM Tony Abbott: \"We do have to ask ourselves the question could it have been prevented?\" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned why the gunman in the Sydney cafe siege was not on the country's terror watch list. He said the government would examine why Man Haron Monis had been on bail. Mr Abbott paid tribute to the two hostages who died in Monday's siege, describing them as \"good people\". The two hostages and Monis died as police commandos stormed the cafe in Martin Place early on Tuesday morning, ending the 16-hour siege. An investigation has been launched into the police operation. Police are also investigating the motives of Monis an Iranian refugee who faced multiple criminal charges and how he got a gun. At a press conference, Mr Abbott said: \"How can someone who has had such a long and chequered history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully.\" Image copyright EPA Rex Features Image caption Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson left and cafe manager Tori Johnson were killed in the siege However, he added that it was \"possible\" that the siege would have taken place even if Monis had been on a watch list. \"The level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very, very high indeed,\" he said. The victims have been named as cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34 and Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson, 38. In Martin Place, people have been arriving to sign condolence books and leave flowers in their memory. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment police stormed the cafe Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC Security Correspondent From Woolwich to Ottawa and now to Sydney, there is a growing list of individuals carrying out attacks in the name of global jihadism yet apparently unconnected to any organisation or co-ordinated plot. Rarely are the perpetrators unknown to the authorities. Monis was a known extremist facing criminal charges. Michael Adebolajo, one of the two Woolwich murderers in 2013, was also a known extremist who had been imprisoned in Kenya. So why were these men allowed to wander around cities, free to pick up knives or guns? The answer comes down to priorities. In open democracies, police and intelligence services do not have the manpower and resources to follow every suspect on their lists around the clock. Inevitably they have to prioritise from an ever-changing list. A radicalising event such as civilians being killed in a drone strike somewhere in the world can draw more people towards a course of violent action. Often that person may keep their thoughts to themselves and not communicate them in ways that can be tracked. In an age of so-called \"lone wolf\" attacks, prioritising suspects is an area the authorities in many countries are going to need to get better at. Four other people, including a police officer, were injured. The officer has been discharged, while the other three were in a stable condition, police said. Central Sydney was put in lockdown on Monday morning as the gunman entered the Lindt Chocolat Cafe and seized 17 hostages. Five hostages managed to sprint to safety on Monday afternoon. Several more escaped early on Tuesday, as commandos stormed the cafe. How the 16-hour Sydney siege unfolded 1.

They later report the deaths of three people, including the gunman. At a news conference on Tuesday, NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn would not say whether Monis had shot the two hostages himself. Nor would she confirm reports that Mr Johnson was shot when he grappled with Monis. But she said all the hostages had \"acted courageously\". Asked why police stormed the cafe, Commissioner Burn would say only that \"shots were heard and an emergency action plan was activated\". She said it was \"extremely important\" she did not comment on events in detail while the investigation is under way.

Police have promised more officers on the street for the next three weeks. At the scene: Wendy Frew, BBC News Online, Australia editor At Christmas time in Sydney, people come to Martin Place to see the giant Christmas tree. This year they have come to see a sea of flowers laid in memory of the victims of this week's cafe shooting. Hundreds of bouquets have been laid on the pedestrian plaza a block away from where the siege took place. Well-wishers like Maureen Sharma and Ruza Fisher have come to sign a condolence book and to lay flowers. The two young office employees who work nearby wanted to pay their respects. \"I came to work this morning and could not stop crying,\" said Ms Sharma. \"It touched me more than I had expected.\" Ms Fisher said her stomach was in knots. \"I am starting to well up. It was such a waste of lives.\" 'Unstable' Monis, a self-styled Muslim cleric, sought asylum in Australia in 1996. He had a history of religiously inspired activism, but officials say there is as yet no evidence his actions were linked to international Islamist movements. He was convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers in 2009. In 2013, he was charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, and given bail. He also faced more than 40 sexual and indecent assault charges. Image copyright EPA Image caption Monis, well known to the Australian police, was facing a raft of criminal charges Monis had \"vehemently denied\" the assault and accessory to murder charges, his former lawyer told the BBC. He \"believed he was being victimised\" for his \"lobbying against the government\", and had alleged that he was tortured while in custody, Manny Conditsis said. According to Australian media, a High Court had dismissed Monis' appeal against his previous convictions on Friday. Image copyright AP Image caption The 16-hour siege saw a major police presence deployed in the heart of Sydney A church service was held at Sydney's St Mary Cathedral on Tuesday to mourn the victims. Archbishop Anthony Fisher said the \"heart of our city is broken by the deaths of two innocents\", and urged Australians not to be caught up in \"violence and its cycle of recrimination\". The Australian National Imams Council issued a statement saying it was \"deeply saddened by the tragic end to the siege with the loss of life. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those killed and to the hostages who suffered the trauma of the siege.\"",
    "reference_summary": "As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.
