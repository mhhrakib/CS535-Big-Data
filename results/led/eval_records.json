    "document": "Most of the Secret Service agents embroiled in a prostitution scandal brought women back to their Colombia hotel rooms before President Obama arrived in town for an international summit, Rep. Pete King said Saturday. King said the raunchy rendezvous involved 11 agents and went sour when an agent refused to pay one of the women, who were presumed to be hookers. \"The agent said, 'I do not owe you anything,' but gave the woman some money,\" said King R-L.I. ,the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, who was briefed on the matter. \"I do not know how much, and it was settled right there.\" IN COLOMBIA, THE SEX BUSINESS IS SO BIG THAT SOME CALL IT THE 'THAILAND OF LATIN AMERICA' As it turned out, the agents' troubles were just beginning. Local cops were called to the hotel in Cartagena and, because the matter involved foreigners, a report was written up and sent to the YOU.S. Embassy, King said. Embassy officials in turn notified the Secret Service, which immediately launched an investigation. At least one supervisor was among the agents involved, King said. He was not certain exactly how many women were involved. The scandal a black eye for the United States' reputation abroad was revealed Friday just hours before President Obama arrived in Cartagena. The 11 agents were part of an advance team assigned to secure a local hotel before the summit began, yet their attention apparently turned to taking advantage of Colombia's policy of legal prostitution. Five American service members were also accused of misconduct stemming from the scandalous incident at the hotel, according to the YOU.S. military. \"They had arranged to have a bunch of prostitutes come by and one of the agents refused to pay a prostitute,\" said author Ronald Kessler, one of the leading experts on the Secret Service. \"Yes, doubly good judgment there.\" Fernando Vergara AP Kessler, who was briefed on the investigation by his sources within the agency, told the Daily News Saturday that the spurned hooker told police about the lack of payment. The 11 agents were immediately recalled to Washington. \"Their careers are over,\" said Kessler. \"Number one, it is against basic ethics to go to a prostitute,\" he continued. \"Number two, it is incredibly embarrassing to the White House.\" \"And number three,\" he continued. \"It could leave them open to blackmail and a possible assassination attempt.\" Obama still has \"full confidence\" in the Secret Service, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney, who declared late Saturday that the incident \"has been more of a distraction for the press\" than the President. Kessler said two of the agents were supervisors who attempted to cover up the mortifying incident. The agents were staying at the beachfront Hotel Caribe, which is also hosting the White House staff and the traveling press team. Guests at the swanky hotel told reporters that several of the agents had been spotted drinking heavily during their weeklong stay. Details of the incident remain murky, but YOU.S. officials believe one agent took a woman back to his room Wednesday night and threw her out in a dispute over money. The woman caused a commotion in the hallway, getting the attention of local cops and other Secret Service agents, a senior official told The New York Times. Though it was not known if all 11 members of the Secret Service team are suspected of wrongdoing, they were all recalled as part of the investigation. Several of the agents are married, according to reports. Prostitution is legal in Colombia, as long as it is conducted in so-called \"tolerance zones.\" Though the exact boundaries of the zones frequently change and are rarely enforced by police, the coastal city of Cartagena is a popular destination for prostitution and sex tourism. Hookers can easily be procured online or in bars or hotels in much of the city. It was not clear how the agents met the women involved in the incident. The scandal threatened to overshadow President Obama's visit to the important summit. He landed in Cartagena Friday night and attended a formal dinner with the other world leaders at Castillo San Felipe de Barajasajas, an historic Spanish fortress. The President, who had a full day of summit events Saturday, has not addressed the Secret Service scandal. He is not staying at the Hotel Caribe. The Secret Service did not elaborate on the allegations Saturday. The night before, the agency which is charged with protecting the President simply confirmed that the officers were pulled back to Washington. All of the agents are based in Washington, D.C., according to Kessler, author of \"In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect.\" The matter was turned over to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles the Secret Services' internal affairs.

AP Photo Carolyn. Associated Press The controversy also expanded to the YOU.S. military, which announced five service members staying at the same hotel as the agents in Colombia may have been involved in misconduct as well. They were confined to their quarters in Colombia and ordered not to have contact with others. All the alleged activities took place before Obama arrived Friday in this Colombian port city for meetings with 33 other regional leaders. Put together, the allegations were an embarrassment for an American president on foreign soil and threatened to upend White House efforts to keep his trip focused squarely on boosting economic ties with fast-growing Latin America. Obama was holding two days of meetings at the Summit of the Americas with leaders from across the vast region before heading back to Washington Sunday night. The Secret Service did not disclose the nature of the misconduct. The Associated Press confirmed on Friday that it involved prostitutes. The White House said Obama had been briefed about the incidents but would not comment on his reaction. \"The president does have full confidence in the United States Secret Service,\" presidential spokesman Jay Carney said when asked. Carney insisted the matter was more a distraction for the media than Obama. But Secret Service assistant director Paul Morrissey said in a statement: \"We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused.\" Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the AP after he was briefed on the investigation on Saturday that \"close to\" all 11 of the agents involved had brought women back to their rooms at a hotel separate from where Obama is now staying. The New York Republican said the women were \"presumed to be prostitutes\" but investigators were interviewing the agents. The lawmaker also offered new details about the controversy. King said he was told that anyone visiting the hotel overnight was required to leave identification at the front desk and leave the hotel by 7 a.m. When a woman failed to do so, it raised questions among hotel staff and police, who investigated. They found the woman with the agent in the hotel room and a dispute arose over whether the agent should have paid her. King said he was told that the agent did eventually pay the woman. The incident was reported to the YOU.S. embassy, prompting further investigation, King said The 11 employees in question were special agents and Uniformed Division Officers. None were assigned to directly protect Obama. All were sent home and replaced, Morrissey said, given \"the nature of the allegations\" and a zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct. The Secret Service says the incidents have had no bearing on its ability to provide security for Obama's stay in Colombia. Another jolt came Saturday when the YOU.S. Southern Command said five service members assigned to support the Secret Service violated their curfew and may have been involved in inappropriate conduct. Carney said it was part of the same incident involving the Secret Service. As for the apparent misconduct by the military members, Gen. Douglas Fraser, commander of YOU.S. Southern Command, said he was \"disappointed by the entire incident\" and said the behavior was \"not in keeping with the professional standards expected of members of the United States military.\" Col. Scott Malcom, chief of public affairs for Southern Command, said of the five service members: \"The only misconduct I can confirm is that they were violating the curfew established. He said he had seen the news reports about the Secret Service agents involved in alleged prostitution at the hotel but could not confirm whether the service members also were involved. The military is investigating. The Secret Service agents at the center of the allegations had stayed at Cartagena's five-star Hotel Caribe. Several members of the White House staff and press corps subsequently stayed at the hotel. King credited the Secret Service director for acting quickly to remove the agents in question and replace them before Obama's arrival. A hotel employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, said the agents arrived at the beachfront hotel about a week ago and said the agents left the hotel Thursday, a day before Obama and other regional leaders arrived for the weekend summit. Three waiters interviewed by the AP at the hotel described the agents as drinking heavily during their stay. On Friday, the hotel began filling up with the delegations of some of the more than 30 countries whose leaders are convening for the weekend Summit of the Americas. The hotel's public relations director, Ana Beatriz Angel, refused to comment on the incident, which she said \"concerns only and exclusively the YOU.S. government.\" On the steamy streets of Cartagena, a resort city with a teeming prostitution trade, there was condemnation for the Secret Service agents for what residents saw as abusing their station and dishonoring their country. Edwin Yepes, a souvenir vendor, said \"they are supposed to come here and set an example. We are an inferior culture, and so it is better if they do not come than if they damage our image of them.\" _ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Ben Feller in Washington, Frank Bajak and Pedro Mendoza in Cartagena and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this story.",

    "document": "Perhaps Google Alphabet? should have googled its new name before it decided to restructure the whole company. The New York Times reports that Google's new parent company, Alphabet, has encountered an issue with german automaker BMW, which owns a fleet services company with the same name and the domain Alphabet.com. A spokesperson for BMW told the Times the company is not planning on selling its domain and that Alphabet was a large part of its business. See also: What Google has to gain by adopting the Alphabet With the major restructuring announcement yesterday, Alphabet launched abc.xyz as its domain name. Alphabet, led by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is now the parent company of Google, a move designed to separate the core products search, Gmail, Android, etc. from its more far reaching projects Fiber, Calico, X, self-driving cars While the move makes sense for Alphabet, it confused many. BMW is looking into whether Google's Alphabet has infringed on its trademark, with no legal action currently planned. Since the announcement, Alphabet.com has been down, likely due to the increased traffic it is undoubtedly receiving. Other companies also have the Alphabet name. Reuters notes that more than 100 companies have trademark registrations in the YOU.S. that incorporate the word alphabet in some capacity. For example, Alphabet, Inc. is an Ohio company founded in 1965 that manufactures electrical components for the auto industry, according to Bloomberg. Even the Alphabet Twitter handle already has an owner. It belongs to a man named Chris Andrikanich, who is probably receiving a bit more attention than he is used to. Well, that was an interesting way to end a Monday. Chris Andrikanich alphabet August 10, 2015 Y Combinator founder Paul Graham wrote a blog post saying it is an absolute must for companies to own the .com domain for their names just days before Google's announcement. While Graham says domains are not as important for finding a company's online presence as they used to be, not owning the .com domain \"signals weakness.\" This might not prove to be an issue for the new Alphabet, however. Google founder Page said Alphabet would not be introducing products under its own name, so it would not be a public facing name like Google. In any event, it is oddly comforting to know Google Alphabet has the same problem many do when they are trying to purchase a domain for their own website. <doc_sep> As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\" From the start, we have always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. more We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we have not stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We have long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant. Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President. What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens and Calico focused on longevity Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that are not very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We will also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we will determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole. This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said and sometimes better! for quite some time now, and I have been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation-continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world's information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth. Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure. Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG. For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google-the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alphabet Alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products-the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands. We are excited about. Getting more ambitious things done. Taking the long-term view. Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish. Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see. Improving the transparency and oversight of what we are doing. Making Google even better through greater focus. And hopefully. as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can. What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Do not worry, we are still getting used to the name too! <doc_sep> Google has bought the alphabet. Not literally of course if that is even possible but it has acquired the domain name abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, just a few days after Google officially became a subsidiary of Alphabet, its new holding company. The domain was created in 1999 and was updated on Wednesday when Google took control of it, according to domain database Whois. It is unclear how much it was bought for. Read More from CNBC: Why Investors Like Google's Alphabet News Google announced its restructuring in August in a bid to separate its core businesses such as search and Android from its \"moonshots\" like driverless cars. At the time, Google unveiled its website with a URL of abc.xyz.

Google owns 18,095 other domains, data on Whois shows. It is the owner of Googl.com and Gogle.com, so if people misspell Google, they will still be redirected to the search engine. Sometimes, companies will make defensive acquisitions of user names in order to prevent them being embarrassed in the future. The YOU.S. tech giant also owns the domain GoogleSucks.com. Read More from CNBC: Alphabet to Back Symphony Messaging Tool The change to Alphabet has caused Google some headaches when it comes to domain names. It does not actually own alphabet.com because it is currently owned by German carmaker BMW. A report in the New York Times earlier this year suggested that BMW does not want to sell it. The news was first reported by DomainInvesting.com.",
    "reference_summary": "Guess Google execs are serious about that whole reorg under the Alphabet parent-company thing. Just days after Alphabet officially became Google's holding company, it scooped up a brand-new domain name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, which has been around since 1999 and was purchased for an unspecified amount, NBC News reports. The page is not functional as of this post, and a company rep says, \"We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we are just being thorough.\" Google set up that website in August. It is hard to imagine Google directing the general public to use the site-would you want to type in all those letters every time?-and NBC notes the domain purchase may simply be a preemptive strike to keep others from usurping it for their own use. Two domains the company probably will not be able to get its hands on: ABC.com for the American Broadcasting Company, owned by Disney and alphabet.com, which BMW is unlikely to give up, notes Consumerist. If you would been hoping to nab the domain for yourself, you can always try to cybersquat the site away when Google's hold on it expires in August 2018. Alphabet has ditched its \"Do not Be Evil\" motto for one that is not as quirky.",

Jennifer Connell claims the boy, Sean Tarala of Westport, acted unreasonable when he leaped into her arms, causing her to fall on the ground and break her wrist four years ago. This week Connell is asking a six-member Superior Court jury to find the boy liable for his actions. She is seeking 127,000 from the boy, who she described as always being \"very loving, sensitive,\" toward her. The boy is the only defendant in the case. In court Friday, the boy, now 12 years old, appeared confused as he sat with his father, Michael Tarala, in the Main Street courtroom. The boy's mother, Lisa Tarala, died last year. On the witness stand before Judge Edward Stodolink, the 54-year-old Connell, a human resources manager in Manhattan, testified she loves Sean but believes he should be held accountable for her injury. On March 18, 2011, Connell, who has no children of her own, arrived at the Tarala home at 25 Woods Grove Road to attend Sean's birthday party. The boy had gotten his first two-wheeler for his birthday, and was joyfully riding the bright-red bike around and around the home, according to testimony. But when he spotted Connell, he dropped the new bicycle on the ground, exclaiming, \"Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen.\" \"All of a sudden he was there in the air, I had to catch him and we tumbled onto the ground,\" Connell testified of her encounter with the 50-pound boy. \"I remember him shouting, 'Auntie Jen I love you,' and there he was flying at me.\" Although hurt, Connell said, she did not complain to the boy at the time. \"It was his birthday party and I did not want to upset him,\" she told the jury. But, Connell continued, her life was turned upside down as a result of the injury. \"I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walk-up so it has been very difficult,\" she said. \"And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.\" And then there is the damage the injury has done to Connell's social life. \"I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate,\" she said. \"The injuries, losses and harms to the plaintiff were caused by the negligence and carelessness of the minor defendant in that a reasonable eight years old under those circumstances would know or should have known that a forceful greeting such as the one delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff could cause the harms and losses suffered by the plaintiff,\" the lawsuit claims.",

The New York City woman, who is suing Sean for 127,000, testified in court Friday that when she arrived at her nephew's birthday party in Westport, Conn., on March 28, 2011, Sean was riding his brand-new bike outside. When he saw Connell, she said, he ran toward her yelling, \"Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen!\" and then flung his 50-pound body at her, knocking them both to the ground and breaking her wrist. \"I remember him shouting, 'Auntie Jen, I love you,' and there he was flying at me,\" she testified.

Even though Connell says Sean-who the Post notes listened with his dad to his aunt's testimony looking \"confused\"; his mom died last year-has always been \"very loving\" and \"sensitive\" toward her, she thinks he should still be liable and understand that his actions have consequences.

Founded by law enforcement officials with over 60 years of experience, MyMatchChecker was created to help protect online daters from the multitude of scammers, identity thieves, sexual predators, felons and even worse. Wherever you are in your relationship, you should do a background check. <doc_sep> Advertisement Continue reading the main story Never mind whether your date is smart or good-looking. How do you know you are not flirting with a felon? For a small fee, a nascent crop of companies wants to help you find out by running background checks on the potential flames you encounter on Match.com, eHarmony or any of the nation's nearly 1,500 dating Web sites. At the same time, at least two states, New York and New Jersey, have begun regulating Internet dating sites, and legal experts say they believe changes to the liability laws that protect such sites are on the horizon. And you thought your mother was the only one who wanted to vet your love life. The focus on background screenings comes as some 20 million Americans are using dating sites, more than double the number five years ago, according to the market research firm IBISWorld. While they are finding casual dates and even love, they are also encountering married people pretending to be single or, worse, sexual predators and convicted felons. No one has put a number on how much violence stems from dating sites, according to groups that keep track of rape and other violent crimes, like the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Victims of Crime. Yet plenty of crime stories begin with two people skimming each other's online dating profiles. Consider the widely reported case of Jeffrey Marsalis, a serial rapist in Philadelphia who met his victims on Match.com. Such perils have been around since the dawn of the Internet, an ideal medium for complex cover-ups. But now that online dating is a billion-dollar industry, state officials, public safety advocates and enterprising businesses are calling for further safeguards. Whether it is possible, however, to effectively screen people and make sites more truthful is unclear. After all, members are not always honest about their age and weight. \"What we want to do is provide some degree of safety,\" said Robert Buchholz, a retired New York State Police captain who, with Andrew J. Scott, a former police chief in Boca Raton, Fla., founded MyMatchChecker.com, a Web site that went live in April, enabling people to request background checks on anyone they have met on a dating site. Mr. Buchholz and Mr. Scott, who each have more than 30 years of law enforcement experience, said that having daughters inspired them to try to make online dating safer. Their company offers a basic background search for 9.95. In addition to Web sites, a flurry of mobile phone apps aim to make background checks as quick and easy as ordering a pizza: Just plug in a couple of facts like a name and birth date. ValiMate, the creator of the Instant National Criminal Search app, even allows users to send the results of the check to a friend for added safety. Date Check, from Intelius, encourages users to \"look up before you hook up.\" The app is marketed to women who want to perform a background check on would-be Romeos \"in the time it takes to redo your lip gloss.\" Industry professionals say that predators are usually men. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story State officials are also pushing for safer Internet dating. A law that takes effect this month in New York State, the Internet Dating Safety Act, requires sites to post common-sense safety tips, like \"meet in a public place.\" Assemblywoman Audrey I. Pheffer, a sponsor of the Internet law, said that it grew out of her realization that online dating had become ubiquitous, even among people she \"never dreamed\" would pursue romance online. Some states have considered similar legislation but ultimately rejected it. New York's law is like one passed in 2008 by New Jersey, which also requires dating sites with a membership fee to inform users whether they do criminal background checks most do not Such legislation was championed by True.com, one of the first major online dating companies to screen members to determine if they are married, felons or sexual offenders about 2 percent of those who try to sign up are rejected, they said Ruben Buell, the company's president, said that the type of checks it conducted were inexpensive. \"You are talking pennies per check.\" Still, most online dating companies question whether such checks can be effective. They contend that because state and county databases are incomplete, the checks give daters a false sense of security. Even advocates of criminal screenings concede that they are imperfect because the databases vary in quality and availability. Some counties, for instance, do not keep digital records. Others do not provide data about sex offenders. \"If I really knew that there was great ability for us to not let anyone on the site that should not be on the site, I would do it,\" said Mandy Ginsberg, the general manager and executive vice president of Match.com. Background checks, she said, might lead daters to think everyone they encounter on the sites is safe. Ms. Pheffer said she originally wanted background checks but decided against them for the same reason. Critics also point out that companies that conduct background screenings are not necessarily perfect. Some have mishandled information. Another concern involves mobile apps, which can provide personal information to people who may abuse it. Braden Cox, a policy counsel for NetChoice, a group that advocates for Internet companies, said that background screenings were well intentioned but that most could be thwarted. \"Most people, thankfully, are good people on these Web sites,\" said Mr. Cox, who speaks from experience: a few weeks ago he married a woman he met on Match.com. Dating sites have no incentive to police their members. The Communications Decency Act absolves Internet service providers of liability because the sites are not considered the publishers of the information on their pages their members are. The reasoning is that sites would not be able to operate if they were responsible for everything posted by their users. Lawyers have tried to get around this law, but \"they usually fail,\" said Brian Carver, an assistant professor at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Every start-up depends on this protection.\" Parry Aftab, a lawyer and safety expert, says she is increasingly hearing about alarming cases involving online dating, like pedophiles who woo single mothers to get near their children. She expects there will be challenges to that immunity if sites accept money from members and have knowledge of criminal behavior. Meanwhile, she advises singles to be cautious. \"Do not give up your heart so fast,\" she said.",

New York and New Jersey are the first two states to offer some regulations on Internet dating sites, such as requiring sites to post safety tips and to say whether they require background checks of their members. Experts say that many more states will soon follow. Although some sites like True.com insist on background checks for all members, other dating sites say this is a false sense of security because criminal screening databases are imperfect. But with online dating a billion-dollar industry, increasingly government officials and public safety advocates are calling for better safeguards.

    "document": "David Frederick, center, outside counsel with Aereo Inc., speaks to the media with Chief Executive Chet Kanojia, left, and General Counsel Brenda Cotter after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the broadcasters' copyright-infringement lawsuit against Aereo. Andrew Harrer Bloomberg If you are comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments in ABC vs. Aereo should change your mind. Admittedly, the case is about copyrights, not circuitry. In particular, the issue focuses on whether Aereo's service violates broadcasters' exclusive rights to transmit works to the public. Yet the inner workings of Aereo's system are crucial to that issue, at least from Aereo's point of view. And the justices struggled to get past a simplistic view of the technology involved. For example, at one point Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that unlike a rooftop TV antenna, the tiny antennas that Aereo sets up in a city could \"pick up every television signal in the world and send it into a person's computer.\" That is physically impossible, not just because antennas are not sensitive enough to detect signals from outside the local market but because the world is not, you know, flat. \"And that sounds so much like what a cable TV system does or what a satellite system does,\" Breyer continued, \"that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that is imposed upon them. That is what disturbs everyone on the court Everyone outside the court should be disturbed by a question like that. At stake here is the degree to which innovative companies are going to have to seek permission from copyright owners to enable people to do in the cloud what they can do for themselves at home. Aereo uses its tiny antennas and circuitry to let people tune in, record and stream local TV programs over the Internet. Because each antenna, recording and stream is initiated and controlled by individual users, Aereo says the online transmissions are not public performances, they are private ones. The networks counter that if Aereo can do that without obtaining licenses, other pay-TV operators will follow suit, destroying an important revenue stream and pressuring them to abandon free over-the-air broadcasting. Justice Sonia Sotomayor opened the session by asking the broadcasters' attorney, veteran Supreme Court litigator Paul D. Clement, why Aereo is not simply a cable TV company. After all, she said, it has facilities that receive transmissions from broadcasters, then send the programs on to subscribers for a fee. Clement's response was that although Aereo is indistinguishable from cable operators in some respects, it is not one largely because the company does not want to be considered one. It fell to Aereo's attorney, David C. Frederick, to point out that Aereo does not collect TV programming and retransmit it in bulk to its subscribers, as cable operators do. Instead, it rents equipment to its subscribers, who use it to watch or record one show at a time. Nothing happens unless it is initiated by the user, he said. To which Sotomayor responded: \"I always thought that if I make a copy of a record and duplicate it a million times the way you are doing it, and I then go out and sell each of those copies to the public, then I am violating the Copyright Act. So why is it that you are not?\" As the question indicates, Sotomayor did not quite catch Frederick's point about who was actually making the recordings Aereo's subscribers and where they were being transmitted to themselves Or maybe she just rejected it as sophistry. Regardless, Frederick said legality of the recordings was not at issue because, as the broadcasters recognized earlier in the case, the Supreme Court held in the Sony Betamax case that people have a fair-use right to record TV shows for later viewing. The right question was the one Justice Elena Kagan eventually put to Clement: Why should copyright law treat a company that rents people a TV antenna hooked to an Internet-connected DVR different than one that sells people the functional equivalent to install at home? The answer, Clement said, was that a private performance becomes a public one when it is transmitted by a service provider from one place to another, rather than by a viewer to himself. Clement's formula ignores the YOU.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling in Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision, in which the appeals court ruled that a cable operator's shared DVR did not violate the networks' copyrights. Under the 2nd Circuit's ruling, who owns the equipment and where it is located are irrelevant to determining whether a performance is public or private. Instead, the court held, what matters is whether the equipment is controlled by users, and whether their recordings and transmissions are theirs alone. If the answer to those questions is yes, then it is a private performance. Aereo designed its service to comply with the 2nd Circuit's ruling, giving users total control over the equipment and making sure none of the recordings or streams was shared. Several justices focused on that aspect, pressing Frederick to say whether the company had any technological reason to use 10,000 dime-sized antennas. Frederick said it was cheaper to set up tiny remote antennas than to install rooftop ones on Manhattan skyscrapers, and to take a modular approach that could minimize the start-up's costs. That response, however, did not seem to mollify Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Antonin Scalia, who suggested that Aereo was just trying to \"get around copyright laws.\" One aspect of the case that seemed to help Aereo was the concern expressed by multiple justices about jeopardizing other cloud-based services, such as online storage lockers. Clement tried to reassure them, saying the difference between Aereo and a cloud-based storage service is like the difference between a car dealership and valet parking. One sells you a car, the other simply parks and returns the car you already own. That is a powerful metaphor, yet it is not quite apt. Aereo is not providing the TV programs, the broadcasters are. Its subscribers then use the equipment they rent from Aereo to tune in the program, make a copy and transmit it to themselves. That latter transmission is a private performance, not a public one, and it is separate legally from the public performance the broadcasters make when they put programs on air. Frederick said that if Clement was right about Aereo being a content provider, it would mean that any company providing an antenna or a DVR was a content provider. \"And if that is true,\" he argued, \"then the implications for the equipment industry are obviously quite massive, and you can understand why that would frighten the cloud computing industry because that turns them into public performers whenever they are handling content.\" A second problem for some justices was Clement's insistence that Aereo, unlike cable operators, would not qualify for a compulsory license to retransmit TV programs if the court ruled in the broadcasters' favor. Under a compulsory license, Aereo would have to pay broadcasters for the content but would not face the daunting task of negotiating for a license from each copyright owner. Clement offered cold comfort on that point. \"If they actually provide something that is a net benefit technologically, there is no reason people will not license them content,\" he told the justices. \"But on the other hand, if all they have is a gimmick, then they probably will go out of business, and nobody should cry a tear over that.\" ALSO: What we do not know about the killing of Anwar Awlaki Free trade on steroids: The threat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Follow Jon Healey on Twitter jcahealey and Google <doc_sep> Aereo, the streaming video service that everyone is talking about but few people actually have, defended its existence today in front of the YOU.S. Supreme Court while lawyers for the nation's broadcasters and the federal government looked to smash the company's tiny antennae into bits. legally speaking. You can read the whole transcript in this PDF. Like most SCOTUS transcripts, it actually makes for an amusing and thoughtful read, while showing that these hearings are much more about a group of people debating the issue instead of some camera-ready lawyer making a made-for-TV speech that knocks the justices' socks off. Since it will be months before the Supremes get around to issuing their opinion on this case, let us bide our time with some highlights from today's arguments. OF PHONOGRAPH RECORDS AND COAXIAL CABLE. At the core of the broadcasters' case is whether or not Aereo's system which uses arrays of antennae to pick up over-the-air TV signals and send them to paying users legally constitutes a \"public performance.\" Playing devil's advocate, Justice Breyer asked the broadcasters' attorney where one draws the line between actual transmission of a copyrighted performance and merely selling access to copyrighted content. \"Why is not what used to be called a phonograph record store that sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers a public performance?\" he inquired while at the same time showing his age The broadcasters countered that a record store is \"not involved in any performance at all\" but said the situation might be different for an online music store where one can both buy music and stream it from the cloud. \"If you provide downloads of music, you get a distribution license or a reproduction license,\" explained the broadcasters' attorney. \"If you provide streaming of music where you also have a contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a public performance license.\" Justice Sotomayor raised the concern that ruling in favor of the broadcasters may inadvertently result in problems for those that provide the required hardware for content delivery. She asked how one could write a ruling \"so that someone who sells coaxial cable to a resident of a building\" or sells passive storage equipment is not \"swept up\" in this issue. \"What does the Court do to avoid a definition or an acceptance of a definition that might make those people liable?\" asked Sotomayor. Once again, the broadcasters argued that hardware providers are not involved in the performance, but is just providing the tools needed for an end-user to access a private performance. \"That is different from an ongoing service, like a cable company or like Aereo,\" said the broadcasters' attorney, \"who still owns all these facilities and they are providing, through wire transmissions, these performances on an ongoing basis.\" AN ISSUE OF LOCATION Justice Kagan asked the broadcasters to clarify the importance of distance and location in making this distinction. \"In other words, if Aereo has the hardware in its warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to the particular end-user, that is going to make all the difference in the world as to whether we have a public performance or not a public performance,\" she asked. JUST SELLING THE HARDWARE. Justice Ginsburg asked Aereo why other transmitters, like cable companies and other online services, pay royalties but Aereo should not? \"The person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio Shack does not pay copyright royalties,\" explained Aereo, which maintains that all it does is rent people a service to access freely available TV feeds online. \"A company that provides a rental service for me to put an antenna in my home and install it, they do not pay copyright royalties either.\" The broadcasters admit that \"if you sell somebody hardware and all they are doing is transmitting it to themselves at their home, there is not going to be a transmission that is chargeable to the person who sold you the hardware,\" but countered that by having these streams coming from a remote location \"it becomes a public performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would be a private performance on behalf of the receiver.\" OF CAR DEALERS AND CLOUD COMPUTING It is that last distinction that the broadcasters believe allows them to challenge Aereo without putting all cloud-based computing and storage technology at risk. \"There is a fundamental difference between a service that. provides new content to all sorts of end-users essentially any paying stranger and a service that provides a locker, a storage service,\" argued the broadcasters, who used the analogous comparison of the difference between a car dealer and a valet parking service. Both of these services \"provide\" cars to people, but there is a huge difference in how they do it. \"If I show up at the car dealership without a car, I am going to be able to get a car. If I show up at the valet parking service and I do not own a car, it is not going to end well for me,\" explained the broadcasters. \"At the end of the day, the car dealer's providing cars to the public, the valet parking service is not. It is providing a parking service.\" But Chief Justice Roberts took issue with this analogy, asking if a better comparison might be between a personal garage and one that is open to the public; i.e., the choice between owning and renting. \"You can go to RadioShack and buy an antenna and a DVR or you can rent those facilities somewhere else from Aereo,\" said Roberts. \"They have got an antenna. They will let you use it when you need it and they can, you know, record the stuff as well and let you pick it up when you need it.\" Aereo contends that what the broadcasters' challenge goes too far and puts all of cloud-based tech at risk by trying to argue that having multiple copies stored of the same content somehow makes Aereo a public performer. \"It means that every time somebody stores something in the cloud whether it is a song, a video image or the like if it happens to be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is going to implicate the public performance right,\" argued Aereo's attorney. \"And that is why the cloud computing industry is freaked out about this case, because they have invested tens of billions of dollars on the notion that a user-specific, user-initiated copy, when perceived by that person, is a private performance and not a public performance.\" THE DEATH OF THE CLOUD DVR? Justice Kennedy asked the broadcasters to distinguish between Cablevision's cloud-based DVR whose legality has never been confirmed by the Supremes and the DVR service offered by Aereo. The broadcasters explain that while still taking issue with Cablevision's device the cable company has already obtained licenses for the initial performance of the programming but Aereo has not. \"Aereo is like if Cablevision. decides, 'Whew, we won, so guess what? Going forward, we are going to dispense with all these licenses, and we are just going to try to tell people we are just an RS DVR, that is all we are, and never mind that we do not have any licensed ability to get the broadcast in the first instance, and we are going to provide it to individual users, and it is all going to be because they push buttons and not because we push buttons.'\" Which is just a ridiculous claim, as the content that goes onto the Cablevision DVRs comes from programming aired on Cablevision's pay-TV network. It does not magically appear there. If Cablevision stopped offering new TV to customers, there would be nothing new to add to the DVRs and the stuff that is already on there would have already been licensed. making it a locker-type storage device that the broadcasters say they have no problem with. Aereo cited the 1984 SCOTUS ruling in favor of Sony, whose Betamax videotapes were going to ruin the Hollywood movie system by allowing people to record things and watch them over and over again. How much does the studio system thank itself for losing that case? \"In Sony, this Court held that consumers have a fair-use right to take local over-the-air broadcasts and make a copy of it,\" argued the company's lawyer. \"All Aereo is doing is providing antennas and DVRs that enable consumers to do exactly what this Court in Sony recognized they can do when they are in their home. and moving the equipment the antennas and the DVRs to the Internet.\" <doc_sep> Analysis In the digital age, perhaps only someone as old as Justice Stephen G. Breyer or older would fret about what might happen to a store that sells \"phonograph records.\" It is doubtful, in the extreme, whether there are any of those anymore, but no matter: Breyer and other Justices searched on Tuesday for ways to demonstrate that they want to be careful about what they do about today's modes of entertainment. With a new method of watching TV via an Internet connection before the Court for analysis, the Court moved back and forth between killing that novelty by forcing it to pay sizable fees to download copyrighted TV programs, or giving it a fighting legal chance to survive as a cheaper alternative to cable. Aside from struggling somewhat to learn just how this new entry in home entertainment actually works, the hour-long hearing in American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc., found the Court quite worried about \"the cloud.\" That is that capacious site, somewhere in the electronic firmament, where all manner of digital expression and indulgences are stored. Maybe even a Super Bowl replay, or two. One lawyer sought to persuade the Court that the cloud is falling, so to speak, while another said not to worry about it, and a third said it means nothing legally if it is only used with \"a gimmick.\" All three of those positions cannot be true, but the Court left little doubt that it will have to spend some time and effort exploring which one of them if any can be believed. The legal issue before the Court is misleadingly simple: is Aereo violating copyright law with its system of renting out thousands of tiny antennas to a growing throng of customers so they can pick and choose the TV programs they want to watch, pulling them from \"the cloud\" whenever the mood stirs them to do so? Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., repeated several times his perception that the only reason Aereo put that system together was to engineer its way around the copyright laws. And, as a general matter, his skepticism seemed to be fairly widely shared across the bench. But there were indications that some members of the Court were thinking that, perhaps, the copyright issue had already been settled in Aereo's favor six years ago, in a lower court decision that the Justices had in fact chosen then not even to review. That ruling goes by the short-form name of Cablevision, because it involved a cable operator's system of maintaining a computer hard drive at its place of business which allowed customers to call up from storage a desired digital recording for viewing at home, using a copy available only to that one user. It was that decision, by the YOU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that led that court to uphold the legality of Aereo's system, finding that it, too, depended mainly upon consumer choice, so there was no public performance of the copyrighted material when the customer downloaded it. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that the lawyers pretend that Cablevision was a ruling by the Supreme Court, so what should be made of it in the context of Aereo's situation? It was the best hope for Aereo, because that company and its lawyers have basically argued that the whole legal issue surrounding its system is solved because the individual consumer makes all of the choices; thus, no illegal public performance of copyrighted works. But, in the context of the argument Tuesday, that was a fine legal point. Most of the energy, at least from the bench, was about the risk that the Court might rule in this case in a way that would smother the infant of digital innovation in its electronic crib. After Justice Breyer first got such a worry on the table with his antique reference to wax recordings of music that are played with a needle, of all things, Justice Sonia Sotomayor did a bit of updating, and asked about the impact on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" She confessed her concern, saying \"this is really hard for me.\" She was, of course, looking for reassurance. The over-the-air TV broadcasting industry's lawyer, Washington attorney Paul D. Clement, was not in the reassuring business on Tuesday. He dismissed Aereo as a pirate of copyrighted music, not a simple peddler of hardware that people could use at home to watch TV. \"Aereo,\" he said, coolly, \"still owns all these facilities and they are providing, through wire transmissions, these performances on an ongoing basis.\" Sensing, perhaps, that he needed to make things simpler, Clement tried to show the distinction through a \"real-world analogy\" between a car dealer and a vendor of a valet parking service. Both of them, he said, provide cars to the public, but the dealer is providing a car, while the valet parker provides a service. Aereo, he implied, is a service provider, not just a product dispenser. The exchanges continued in that vein with a federal government lawyer, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart, who is mostly siding with the broadcasters. He seemed to have a little less technical knowledge than some of the Justices, but that did not much deter him from suggesting that the Court need not worry much in this case about \"the cloud,\" which he seemed to prefer calling \"pure cloud locker service.\" He was candid enough, though, to tell Justice Kennedy that, if the Court interprets the Cablevision decision as validating the individual consumer as the one who chooses to \"perform\" a copyrighted work, then \"it is hard to see how you could rule in favor of our position here.\" Aereo's lawyer, Washington attorney David C. Frederick, could not have had a better lead-in to his argument than Stewart's concession. Aereo's whole case, he made clear throughout his argument, depends upon the Court looking at Aereo's system as seeing only the end-user, calling up his or her own downloads for private viewing. All that his client does, Frederick said, \"is attempting to entice consumers to replicate on the cloud what they can do at home at lower cap costs and more efficiency.\" It is like using the Internet, he added: \"You cannot do multiple channels on the Internet anyway. You can only do a single video stream at a time. So whether you have one big antenna or whether you have lots of little antenna as Aereo does you still have to compress the signal and only one can go over the Internet at a time.\" His ultimate rhetorical weapon, though, given the concerns of the Justices about where this case potentially might lead, was a repeated suggestion that \"the cloud computer industry\" is deeply worried about how the Court might rule. If what Aereo does is illegal, he argued, \"every time somebody stores something in the cloud, whether it is a song, a video image or the like, if it happens to be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is going to implicate the public performance right, that is why the cloud computing industry is freaked out about this case.\" No more so, it seemed, than the Justices themselves.

    "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in ABC v. Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television-implications the justices did not seem comfortable with. Aereo allows users to record broadcast TV online and watch it at their leisure. The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it is simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here is how the arguments went: \"If you are comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which is not true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world is not, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It is not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I do not find that very satisfying. I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices did not seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I do not see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

    "document": "President Trump's legal team believes Attorney General Jeff Session's Justice Department and the FBI more than special counsel Robert Mueller himself are to blame for what they see as a witch hunt. The result: They want an additional special counsel named to investigate the investigators. Trump officials outlined their new line of thinking to me last night. <doc_sep> Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his team of a dozen-plus lawyers and investigators have proven stealthy in their wide-ranging Russia probe. They have surprised the White House with one indictment after another, and summoned President Trump's confidants for lengthy interviews. In the case of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort alone, court filings show, they have collected more than 400,000 documents and 36 electronic devices. Mueller and his deputies are, in the fearful word of some Trump loyalists, \"killers.\" Trump's response, by contrast, is being directed by John M. Dowd, the president's personal lawyer retired from a large firm who works essentially as a one-man band, and Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer who works out of a small office in the West Wing basement, near the cafeteria where staffers get lunch. Dowd and Cobb, along with attorney Jay Sekulow, serve not only as Trump's lawyers but also as his strategists, publicists, therapists and based on Dowd's claim that he wrote a controversial presidential tweet ghostwriters. When Mueller requests documents, they provide them. When Trump reacts to new twists in the Russia saga, they seek to calm him down. When he has questions about the law, such as the Logan Act or Magnitsky Act, they explain it. And when the president frets that Mueller may be getting too close to him, they assure him he has done nothing wrong, urge him to resist attacking the special counsel and insist that the investigation is wrapping up first, they said, by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas and now by early next year. As lawyers for the world's highest-profile client, Dowd and Cobb have come under scrutiny for their every move and utterance and the criticism has been harsh. Many in the Washington legal community chide them as being indiscreet, error-prone and outmatched. They say public blunders such as Dowd and Cobb casually chatting about their legal strategy on the patio of a downtown Washington steakhouse in September within earshot of a reporter suggest a lack of discipline. Critics also question why, seven months into Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, they have not assembled a battalion of lawyers as President Bill Clinton had when he was being investigated by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. And some Trump loyalists, spoiling for a fight, say the president's lawyers should be combative rather than cooperative with Mueller. \"There certainly have been gaffes,\" said Alan Dershowitz, a criminal defense attorney and Harvard Law School professor who has won praise from Trump for his television appearances defending a president's constitutional prerogative to fire his FBI director. \"These are not the kinds of things that one would expect from the most powerful man in America, who has a choice of anybody to be his defense counsel,\" Dershowitz said. \"Well almost anybody,\" he added, saying that he is not interested in the job. Trump's legal team faces tensions and a client who often takes his own counsel Lawyer Ty Cobb, left, in 2004 and Jay Sekulow, in 2015. The two, along with John Dowd, are representing President Trump in the Russia probe, serving as his strategists, publicists and therapists. AP photos AP photos This portrait of Trump's legal team and defense strategy is based on interviews with more than two dozen White House officials, lawyers and other people connected to the Russia probe, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. The chorus of criticism may be growing louder, but Trump is not singing along. By most accounts, the president is satisfied with his representation and talks to Cobb several times a day though advisers say he has occasionally discussed bringing on new lawyers. Trump, 71, connects with Dowd, 76, and Cobb, in his mid-60s, as contemporaries. He appreciates their no-nonsense old-school style, and likes that neither appears on television, believing their absence from the airwaves deprives what he calls the Russia \"witch hunt\" of oxygen, according to Trump's advisers. A former Marine Corps captain, Dowd has a gruff demeanor and has proven able at times to cool Trump's temper and convince him of the virtues of pragmatism over pugnacity, aides said. Some Trump advisers dismiss Cobb's predictions that the Mueller probe is nearing its conclusions as misleading happy talk, but the president has internalized it as reality. One reason for Trump's faith is his belief that his lawyers are plugged in. Cobb tells him he is in frequent, and sometimes daily, contact with the special counsel's office, according to people familiar with the dynamic. Over Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump boasted to friends that Cobb was \"brilliant\" and that he was certain Mueller would soon exonerate him. Cobb declined to comment, and Dowd responded to an email inquiry with two words: \"No, thanks.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \"The president is happy with his legal team.\" Cobb works as a White House lawyer whose salary is paid by the government, and his duty is to the office of the presidency, whereas Dowd and Sekulow are employed by Trump and represent him personally. Dowd and Sekulow enjoy attorney-client privilege, but Cobb does not meaning that Mueller could seek access to Cobb's notes or ask to interview him about his interactions with the president. Trump lawyer John Dowd brought down Pete Rose. Almost 30 years later, they are still fighting. Mark Corallo, a Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, served as spokesman for Trump's legal team earlier this year. Corallo is no longer involved, but he praised Dowd and Cobb as \"titans.\" \"They have been at the top of their profession and were on the shortlist of the top 10 attorneys you would call if you got your knickers in a twist,\" Corallo said. He added, \"One thing I like is Cobb and Dowd are of the same generation as the president. They are contemporaries. There is a comfort that comes with being able to talk with somebody who shares your experience in the world.\" Still, there have been moments of tension. Last Tuesday, anxiety ran high early in the morning because of a report out of Germany that Mueller's office had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to the transactions of Trump and people close to him. Trump was unnerved, but his lawyers tried to soothe his irritation and scrambled to determine whether the report was accurate, aware that if Mueller were digging into Trump's finances, he would be crossing a red line the president had publicly set, according to three people familiar with the discussions. After the lawyers consulted with the special counsel's office, Sekulow issued a statement that afternoon saying that Trump's team had confirmed there was no subpoena for Trump's records. The Trump administration's key people in the Russia investigation including the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner are represented by different attorneys. But some of the various lawyers, along with Dowd and Cobb, cooperate by sharing information on regular conference calls about questions their clients have been asked and documents they have turned over. Witnesses in Mueller's probe and their lawyers have reported back to Cobb and Dowd that the special counsel's team has asked detailed questions about Trump's May firing of James B. Comey as FBI director, leading them to believe that Mueller may be gathering evidence of obstruction of justice, according to one witness. But Cobb and Dowd have told Trump he has no vulnerability, officials said. Dowd went so far as to posit last week to Axios that a president cannot obstruct justice because of his constitutional powers as the chief law enforcement officer an interpretation that was mocked by some legal scholars. A bold new legal defense for Trump: Presidents cannot obstruct justice On December 2, Trump tweeted that he fired Michael Flynn as national security adviser in part because he had lied to the FBI an admission that could become evidence in an obstruction investigation. Dowd claimed he drafted the tweet, and fellow lawyers privately said they could not believe a statement so careless was written not by the impulsive president but by his lawyer. One of Trump's advisers told the president that weekend: \"The first job of a lawyer is to shut up. The second job of a lawyer is to keep their client's mouth shut. I do not know why they are tweeting and talking and trying to explain the tweet,\" according to someone with knowledge of the conversation. People close to the Trump legal team argue that additional lawyers could result in a more proactive and careful approach. \"It is amazing the stress and magnitude of representing the president of the United States,\" said one person familiar with the inner workings. \"You would have to be super human to do it alone. You have got 16 of the best lawyers in the country going up against you.\" For Trump, being under the glare of a legal investigation is familiar territory. A real estate developer and reality-television star before becoming a politician, he has spent much of his professional life enmeshed in litigation. When Mueller's Russia investigation began in May, Trump hired as his lead attorney Marc Kasowitz, a litigator from New York with a brawler reputation who had represented Trump and his companies off and on for years in divorce, bankruptcy and other proceedings. In the early weeks of the Mueller probe, the hard-charging Kasowitz would scurry in and out of the Oval Office and the adjoining dining room in what aides described as a running and at times frenzied commentary with Trump about all things Russia. But Kasowitz had scant experience in Washington and with investigations like Mueller's. After he caused a kerfuffle by sending an expletive-laced and disparaging email to a stranger who had criticized him, Kasowitz departed the Russia legal team. He continues to represent Trump in some other matters. When Trump goes looking for a media brawl, this feared lawyer steps in Trump tried to hire or has considered hiring more than a half dozen top litigators to help manage the Russia probe, including William A. Burck, Mark Filip, Emmet Flood, Robert J. Giuffra, Ted B. Olson and Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., according to several people with knowledge of the president's deliberations. For various reasons, none took the job. \"If you are the president of the United States, typically the top lawyers are lining up to pitch you,\" said one person close to the White House and familiar with the legal team's dynamics. \"Here, you have the opposite.\" Bob Bauer, who was President Barack Obama's White House counsel, said in assessing the Trump legal team: \"Some people may want to blame the lawyers, but my principal question is, 'How do you represent a client like Trump?' And at what point do these lawyers decide they are so hemmed in, so compromised by his behavior, his impulses, his tweets, that they just cannot represent him effectively?\" The face of the legal team has been Sekulow, who has deep ties to the Christian right, though he has adopted a lower profile since the spring and summer when he was a frequent television presence. Cobb, who had been a partner at Hogan Lovells, enjoys a reputation as a seasoned white-collar advocate whose last high-stakes legal case involving Washington politics was in the 1990s. Dowd has been a higher-profile criminal defender and represented Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. during a 1990 ethics investigation into whether McCain had improperly intervened in a savings and loan probe. He is perhaps best known for representing the commissioner of baseball in the late 1980s and producing the \"Dowd Report,\" a document that resulted in Pete Rose's lifetime suspension from the sport. Dowd was widely perceived by other lawyers to be in the twilight of his career, having formally retired in 2015 from Akin Gump, where he had worked since 1990. Dowd lost one of his most recent big cases when his client, hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, was convicted in 2011 on insider trading charges in New York. Preet Bharara, the YOU.S. attorney prosecuting Rajaratnam, reflected on facing Dowd in that trial in an episode last week of his podcast, \"Stay Tuned with Preet.\" \"John Dowd said a lot of how shall I put it? ludicrous, silly things,\" said Bharara, who was fired as YOU.S. attorney two months into the Trump administration. At one point, Dowd was filmed swearing at and flashing his middle finger at reporters covering the trial. It garnered him unflattering press coverage but it was the kind of dramatic move that a client like Trump could see as an attribute.

Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence HPSCI confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr's duties including whether she worked on the dossier remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016. Fusion GPS has attracted scrutiny because Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page. \"The House Intelligence Committee,\" Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News in a statement on Monday, \"is looking into all facets of the connections between the Department of Justice and Fusion GPS, including Mr. Ohr.\" Until December 6, when Fox News began making inquiries about him, Bruce Ohr held two titles at DOJ. He was, and remains, director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force; but his other job was far more senior. Mr. Ohr held the rank of associate deputy attorney general, a post that gave him an office four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The day before Fox News reported that Mr. Ohr held his secret meetings last year with the founder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier, the Justice Department stripped Ohr of his deputy title and ousted him from his fourth floor office at the building that DOJ insiders call \"Main Justice.\" The Department of Justice has provided no public explanation for Ohr's demotion. Officials inside the Department have told Fox News his wearing of two hats was \"unusual,\" but also confirm Ohr had withheld his contacts with the Fusion GPS men from colleagues at the DOJ. Former FBI Director James Comey has described the dossier as a compendium of \"salacious and unverified\" allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump and his associates, including Page, a foreign policy adviser. The dossier was provided to the FBI in July 2016, shortly before then-candidate Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination. As Comey later testified, it was in that same month that the FBI began a counterintelligence probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The disclosure by Fox News that Bruce Ohr met with Simpson and Steele last year expanded the reach of the dossier's creators from the FBI into the top echelons of the Justice Department. Initial investigation suggested that Steele, a longtime FBI informant whose contacts with Mr. Ohr are said to date back a decade, might have played the central role in putting Simpson together with the associate deputy attorney general. Now, the revelation that Mrs. Ohr worked for Simpson calls that account into question. A review of open source materials shows Mrs. Ohr was described as a Russia expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, when she worked there, briefly, a decade ago. The Center's website said her project focused on the experiences of Russian farmers during Stalin's collectivization program and following the invasion of Russia by Nazi forces in 1941. She has also reviewed a number of books about twentieth century Russia, including Reconstructing the State: Personal Networks and Elite Identity in Soviet Russia 2000 by Gerald Easter, a political scientist at Boston College, and Bertrand M. Patenaude's The Big Show in Bololand: The American Relief Expedition to Soviet Russia in the Famine of 1921 2002 Contacted by Fox News late Monday, DOJ officials declined to comment. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, declined to comment on the original disclosure about Mr. Ohr's secret meetings, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mrs. Ohr. While Nunes has issued numerous subpoenas to DOJ and FBI relating to the dossier, and has threatened contempt-of-Congress citations against Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray for what congressional Republicans have termed \"stonewalling\" by the two agencies, Schiff has mostly objected to the demands for documents and witnesses, casting the entire dossier probe as innately political. \"I think there is a hope that if they can impeach Christopher Steele, and they can impeach the FBI and DOJ, maybe they can impeach the whole Russia investigation,\" Schiff told MSNBC in September. James Rosen joined FOX News Channel FNC in 1999 and is the network's chief Washington correspondent.",

But Mike Allen of Axios reports on another strategy being explored by the president's legal team: Appoint a second special counsel to investigate Mueller's investigation. The story suggests that Trump's attorneys trust Mueller himself but not others in the Justice Department. For example, they point to a Fox News story Monday detailing how the wife of a Justice Department official named Bruce Ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier that emerged during the election. Ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company, Fusion GPS. \"The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow tells Axios. \"These new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.\" It is not clear how likely this is to happen, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of GOP concerns.

    "document": "The chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says President Barack Obama might be taking too long to respond to the growing threat from Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. \"I have learned one thing about this president, and that is he is very cautious. Maybe, in this instance, too cautious,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Feinstein said she agrees with an op-ed by Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina over the weekend in The New York Times calling for an immediate military plan to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL's goal, she said, is to take the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and attack the American Embassy there. Though Obama was widely criticized last week for saying the White House did not have a strategy for dealing with ISIL, Feinstein said the Pentagon and State Department have been planning for some time. And, she said, she hopes those plans will \"coalesce\" into a strategy that a coalition of allies can use to confront the militant group. Feinstein did praise Obama for including the new Iraqi government in the planning. \"What I understand he is trying to do is give an opportunity for this new Iraqi government to make a move that offers an alternative to the Sunni people in the country,\" she said. Read more about: Barack Obama, Iraq, Dianne Feinstein, Syria <doc_sep> The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said on Sunday that President Barack Obama's \"do not-do-stupid-stuff\" approach to foreign affairs is not working and that the White House's response to multiple international crises is causing problems for allies. Appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Rep. Mike Rogers R-Mich. said the president needs a stronger response to provocations from Russia and China and to the terrorist threat from Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq. \"This is an opportunity for the president to bring the country together so that we understand this 'do not-do-stupid-stuff' policy is not working,\" Rogers said. \"If the world perceives that the United States does not have a consistent policy of saying what it means and meaning what it says, you are going to see more of this pressure.\" Rogers said the president has not taken strong enough action against Russia's incursions into Ukraine and has taken too long to respond to the growing threat of Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq. And, he said, the perceived weakness of the response has encouraged China to push limits in international waters and forced Britain to increase its security measures in the face of threats from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \"The United States seems to be in the malaise of not being that concerned,\" Rogers said. \"If you have your own European allies saying, 'Maybe the United States is not a leader on this issue,' that is a problem for us.\" Read more about: Barack Obama, Iraq, Russia, Foreign Policy, Mike Rogers, Syria <doc_sep> Sen. John McCain on Sunday called for \"additional YOU.S. troops\" to help in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, but he said those troops should continue playing a support role and not be directly involved in combat. Appearing on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" the Arizona Republican blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the issue, saying \"he is either in denial or overwhelmed.\" \"This is a direct threat to the United States of America,\" McCain said of the extremist group's grip on parts of Iraq and Syria. \"It may be one of the biggest we have ever faced.\" Specifically, McCain urged the Obama administration to provide more weapons to Kurdish fighters in Iraq and to expand the YOU.S. military airstrikes in Iraq to Syria.

Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday defended President Barack Obama's much-criticized Thursday remark that when it comes to taking on the Islamic State extremist group in Syria, \"We do not have a strategy yet.\" Appearing on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" the Maryland congressman said the Obama administration is working to develop a plan and that \"when the time is right, we will do what we have to do.\" Ruppersberger said dealing with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, in Syria was very different than dealing with the group in Iraq, where \"the government wants us to come in.\" Syria, he said, has sophisticated air defense systems, and the United States has limited intelligence about potential targets in the war-ravaged country. \"It is extremely urgent, but you just do not rush in because the media's talking about it,\" Ruppersberger said. \"We will do what we have to do to protect us from ISIS,\" he said, using another acronym for the group. Meanwhile, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Iraq War veteran, said the United States should have started working much earlier to stop ISIL and knocked the president for his \"strategy\" remark. \"I think it is unfortunate that he used the term, we have no strategy in Syria,\" the Illinois Republican said.

Flynt, who built an empire of smut starting with Hustler magazine, is a longtime Democratic supporter. \"The thought of Donald Trump becoming president nauseates me in a big way,\" Flynt told Toronto-based HOSS magazine. And if Trump wins? \"I do not know, maybe move to Canada,\" Flynt, 73, said.

Handler, Dunham and Stewart are among many celebrities who have said, jokingly or otherwise, that if Trump is elected, they will leave the United States. Many would consider moving to Canada. There is a website called cbiftrumpwins.com Cape Breton If Donald Trump Wins that shows off the beauty of the Canadian island and suggests people come there. The site advertises the island's good weather, affordable housing, magnificent scenery and friendly people; it is had over a million visits. Since the beginning of 2016, a surprising number of celebs have gone on record to say that a Trump presidential win will prompt them to move. Cher, for example, said she would move to Jupiter if Trump got elected. At the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Vanity Fair magazine captured a dozen famed folk talking about their plans to flee a Trump-led America; Armie Hammer, star of The Social Network and The Man from YOU.N.C.L.E. came up with the great idea of moving to the Caribbean and starting a Jet Ski business. Some of the others who weighed in include Chloe Sevigny, who says she will move to Nova Scotia if Trump becomes president, Elizabeth Moss, who says she is always had a hankering to live in Italy, and Kathryn Hahn, who opted for Iceland rather than sticking around, should Trump sit in the Oval Office. Anyone who has seen Hahn in the spectacularly funny film Bad Moms, which opens Friday, knows this would be Iceland's gain. Lily Rose Depp says she would live in France. Gabrielle Union might go to the Bahamas. Zosia Mamet was no doubt kidding when she said she would move to Siberia.

Can Trump-and we-come together and save America for the second time? Want to connect with Dinesh D'Souza online for more hard-hitting analysis of current events in America? Here is how: Facebook: https: www.facebook.com dsouzadinesh Twitter: https: twitter.com dineshdsouza Instagram: https: www.instagram.com dineshjdsouza Email: http: www.dineshdsouza.com email <doc_sep> On May 31, President Donald Trump, one of America's premiere conservative trolls, decided to pardon Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative writer and documentarian whose penchant for trolling and needling liberals, and embracing conspiracy theories in the process, rivals that of Trump himself. If that comparison seems unfair, just watch the trailer for D'Souza's 2016 film, Hillary's America: It references D'Souza's past conviction for violating campaign finance law for which Trump is pardoning him portraying his prosecution as a politically motivated witch hunt, and seeks to tie the current Democratic party to the Ku Klux Klan and slaveowners Democrats were historically the pro-segregation, pro-slavery party until the parties flipped on race around 1964 It features a cameo from Jonah Goldberg, the National Review writer best known for his universally discredited attempt to equate New Deal liberalism with European fascism. It is peppered with over-the-top voiceovers by D'Souza \"What are these Democrats hiding?\"; \"What if the goal of the Democratic party is to steal the most valuable thing the world has ever produced? What if their plan is to steal America?\" over an ominous, melodramatic score. This kind of silliness and purposeful provocation on race is D'Souza's bread and butter. See this tweet from 2015: YOU CAN TAKE THE BOY OUT OF THE GHETTO.Watch this vulgar man show his stuff, while America cowers in embarrassment pic.twitter.com C9yLG4QoOK Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 18, 2015 After people on Twitter pointed out that this is extremely racist, D'Souza replied with the most tepid of quasi-apologies: I know Obama was not actually raised in a ghetto-I am using the term metaphorically, to suggest his unpresidential conduct Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 18, 2015 Someone with only a light exposure to D'Souza's oeuvre might be tempted to dismiss this and Hillary's America as ludicrous attention grabs from a fringe criminal, and perhaps they would be right to do so. But D'Souza was for decades a member in good standing of American conservative intellectual life, who served in the Reagan administration; was affiliated with serious, respected conservative think tanks; and was a big player in the campus right's 1980s rise to prominence. In 2007, that suddenly started to change, and his work took on a more conspiratorial, hyperbolic tone, culminating in stuff like the Obama selfie stick tweet. At the same time, D'Souza's work has become more popular, and arguably even more influential. And throughout, he is expressed same attitude toward race displayed in that tweet. And now, with Trump as president, D'Souza is finally being welcomed back into the conservative mainstream, as a pioneer of the kind of politics our president has brought to the national stage. Here is a basic primer on who D'Souza is, and how he got to this point. 1 Who is Dinesh D'Souza? Dinesh D'Souza is an American conservative writer and commentator. He briefly worked in the Reagan White House on domestic policy issues from 1987 to 1988; has served as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute AEI and the Hoover Institution; and was president of The King's College, a small evangelical school in Manhattan, from 2010 to 2012. But D'Souza is probably best known for his writing. He is written 16 books, many of them best-sellers, most of which either critique liberal attitudes on race and gender Illiberal Education, The End of Racism defend the concept of America against perceived enemies What is So Great About America, America: Imagine a World Without Her or defend orthodox Christian theology What is So Great About Christianity, Life After Death: The Evidence He is also taken a turn into documentary filmmaking in recent years. His 2012 film 2016: Obama's America is the fourth-best-performing documentary at the box office ever, and the second-best-performing political documentary after Fahrenheit 9 11. He followed it up with America: Imagine the World Without Her, based on the book of the same name, which was released in 2014. 2 How did D'Souza's career start? D'Souza first came to prominence as a student at Dartmouth he graduated in 1983 where he was one of the first editors of the Dartmouth Review, a still-extant conservative campus publication. During his time there, the Review: The last of those incidents prompted then-classmate and future Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to go up to D'Souza at a coffee shop and ask him \"how it felt to be such a dick,\" an event Geithner recounted in his memoir Stress Test and in an interview with Vox: After graduating from Dartmouth, D'Souza moved to Princeton, New Jersey, to edit a small magazine called Prospect, which targeted Princeton students and was overseen by a conservative alumni group, Concerned Alumni for Princeton, that counted future Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito among its members. D'Souza's most infamous article at Prospect concerned a freshman whose mother had stopped paying tuition upon discovering her daughter was having sex with a fellow student. D'Souza was outraged that Princeton offered the student financial aid after her mother stopped supporting her. Students reacted poorly to the violation of their classmate's privacy, organizing a petition condemning D'Souza. From Prospect, D'Souza moved to the magazine Policy Review, then affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, and from there to the Reagan administration. He opted to go to AEI rather than join the George H. W. Bush administration, and started writing his most successful books there before leaving for the Hoover Institution in 2001, where he remained until 2007. 3 What does D'Souza believe? Probably the best way to interrogate D'Souza's beliefs is by going through what his major books argued. Illiberal Education 1991 is a fairly standard-issue critique of what D'Souza deems \"political correctness\" on college campuses, focusing in particular on affirmative action policies in both student admissions and faculty hiring, and on what D'Souza saw as an abandonment of the traditional Western canon through the inclusion of more modern female, non-white, and non-heterosexual writers. The book got a largely respectful reception, with Tom Wolfe, Robert Bork, and most strikingly Morton Halperin then the ACLU's DC director and a fairly down-the-line liberal providing blurbs. Nancy Dye, then an English professor at Vassar, was less positive, writing in the New York Times, \"Mr. D'Souza has constructed his argument by cobbling together anecdotal accounts of campus incidents.\" The End of Racism 1995 was considerably more incendiary. Here are a few lines from the book: The book got a respectful hearing in some corners; historian George Frederickson called it the \"most thorough, intelligent, and well-informed presentation of the case against liberal race policies that has yet appeared\" in the New York Review of Books. By contrast, philosopher Richard Rorty wrote a takedown for the New York Times, consisting largely of direct quotations from the book, and concluding, \"Conceivably somebody could make a case for the claim that white Americans are now entitled to relax, go color-blind, and let the African-Americans rebuild their culture on their own. Mr. D'Souza has not even begun to make it.\" Economist Glenn Loury and community activist Paul Ryan mentor Robert Woodson, who are both black, resigned their posts at AEI in protest of the book. The Virtue of Prosperity 2000 released in the midst of the dot-com boom, is a celebration of the new wave of capitalism, and in particular the fact that going into business and making money is \"seen as cool.\" He is even enthusiastic about biological enhancements to human life, musing that perhaps \"the history of our species can be written with the epitaph that we tried out humanity, found it wanting, and opted for something better.\" The book, understandably, caused much less of a stir than The End of Racism had, but as Slate's Tim Noah noted at the time, it is notable for containing a critique of the very idea of equality of opportunity. It is unfair, D'Souza argues, for the state to deny his daughter the edge he is attempted to give her through sending her to great schools, offering her ballet and chess lessons, and so on: Now, to enforce equal opportunity, the government could do one of two things: it could try to pull my daughter down, or it could work to raise other people's children up. The first is clearly destructive and immoral, but the second is also unfair. The government is obliged to treat all citizens equally. Why should it work to undo the benefits that my wife and I have labored so hard to provide? Why should it offer more to children whose parents have not taken the trouble? What is So Great About America and Letters to a Young Conservative followed, but D'Souza's next major book was 2007's The Enemy at Home. 4 What was The Enemy at Home and why was it so controversial? The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9 11 argues exactly what its name implies. \"In faulting the cultural left, I am not making the absurd accusation that this group blew up the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,\" he writes. \"I am saying that the cultural left and its allies in Congress, the media, Hollywood, the nonprofit sector, and the universities are the primary because of the volcano of anger toward America that is erupting from the Islamic world. The Muslims who carried out the 9 11 attacks were the product of this visceral rage.\" He provides an actual list of the people he is blaming at the end of the book, breaking them up into the Congressional Left Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Mikulski the Intellectual Left Eric Hobsbawm, Cornel West, Tony Judt the Hollywood Left Barbra Streisand, Harry Belafonte, Jane Fonda the Activist Left Michael Moore, George Soros, Mumia Abu-Jamal the Foreign Policy Left Gore Vidal, Seymour Hersh, Jimmy Carter and the Cultural Left Al Franken, Salman Rushdie, Ellen Willis What is the Matter with Kansas? author Thomas Frank has the distinction of appearing twice, as a member of both the Intellectual and Cultural Left. The Enemy at Home was rejected by much of the conservative movement, not least because of the implication that D'Souza agrees with some Islamist critiques of Western culture. For instance, D'Souza writes, \"the political right and the Islamic fundamentalists are on the same wavelength on social issues,\" and, \"Yes I would rather go to a baseball game or have a drink with Michael Moore than with the grand mufti of Egypt. But when it comes to core beliefs, I would have to confess that I am closer to the dignified fellow in the long robe and prayer beads than to the slovenly fellow with the baseball cap.\" National Review hosted a symposium on the book that was overwhelmingly negative. Roger Kimball, who had issued a glowing review of Illiberal Education, wrote, \"The problem with The Enemy at Home is well, everything.\" Military historian Victor Davis Hanson wrote, \"It is the singular achievement of D'Souza that his bizarre writ has for a moment earned universal condemnation from those who can agree on little else.\" Liberals, of course, joined in the critique. \"Ordinarily I would never equate hard-right views on social issues with the rantings of an Islamist terrorist,\" Noah wrote. \"I do so now only because D'Souza has written an entire book encouraging me to do just that.\" By the end of the year, D'Souza had left the Hoover Institution, a development that Newsweek's David Sessions, in a profile of D'Souza, suggests was hardly accidental. BONUS QUESTION Can I get a music break? Sort of? There is no obvious musical accompaniment to D'Souza's career, but this is better, I promise. D'Souza appeared in an infomercial for his friend Bruce Schooley's invention, the Fliptree: a pre-lit, multi-component artificial Christmas tree designed to be easy to move and store. It is delightful: Thanks to Elon Green for the pointer. 5 What is D'Souza's view of Barack Obama? Not positive! D'Souza has a distinctive grand unifying theory of Obama, expressed in a 2010 Forbes feature; his books The Roots of Obama's Rage, America: Imagine a World Without Her, and Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream; and his two documentaries. He rejects the frequent conservative attack that Obama is a European-style or perhaps Alinskyan socialist at heart, arguing instead that Obama is best understood through the lens of anticolonialism, in particular Kenya's struggle against British imperialism. Obama was taught by his father, D'Souza argues, to view the US as an imperialist actor trampling upon states both through outright war as in Vietnam or Iraq and through economic exploitation, a natural successor to the more formal role that the British Empire played in much of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. \"From a very young age and through his formative years, Obama learned to see America as a force for global domination and destruction,\" D'Souza writes. \"He came to view America's military as an instrument of neocolonial occupation. He adopted his father's position that capitalism and free markets are code words for economic plunder.\" Everything Obama does can be understood in light of these fundamental commitments, D'Souza believes: \"Why support oil drilling off the coast of Brazil but not in America? Obama believes that the West uses a disproportionate share of the world's energy resources, so he wants neocolonial America to have less and the former colonized countries to have more Obama supports the Ground Zero mosque because to him 9 11 is the event that unleashed the American bogey and pushed us into Iraq and Afghanistan. He views some of the Muslims who are fighting against America abroad as resisters of YOU.S. imperialism.\" As was the case with The Enemy at Home, many conservatives rejected D'Souza's theory as preposterous, noting that there are plenty of other, much more plausible explanations for why the Democratic president has pursued policies roughly in line with the Democratic platform, and that Obama's memoir made it very clear that he, far from wanting to emulate his father's politics, was deeply disappointed in him. In a particularly pointed piece, The Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson identified \"misstatements of fact, leaps in logic, and pointlessly elaborate argumentation\" throughout the book. \"There is, indeed, a name for the beliefs that motivate President Obama, but it is not anticolonialism; it is not even socialism. It is liberalism!\" he writes. \"Nearly everything that Obama has done as president, including the policies that D'Souza cites as proof of his inherited anticolonial ideology, would have been as eagerly pursued by President John Edwards or President John Kerry.\" For liberals, meanwhile, \"Kenyan anticolonialist\" became something of a punchline. Matt Steinglass at the Economist decided to turn the tables on D'Souza and concocted a byzantine explanation for D'Souza's conservatism, based upon his family's caste, Catholicism, and position within the Portuguese Indian territory of Goa, that is just as unnecessary as D'Souza's explanation for Obama's liberalism. James Mann at the New Republic added, for good measure, \"anti-colonialism is itself not exactly alien to American traditions; our country was founded on it.\" But some important conservatives took D'Souza seriously. In 2010, Newt Gingrich called his argument \"the most profound insight I have read in the past six years about Barack Obama,\" adding, \"Only if you understand Kenyan, anticolonial behavior can you piece together Obama's actions That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior.\" 6 What are these D'Souza scandals from a few years back? There are two D'Souza scandals, more or less. The first came and went in 2012, when World Magazine a prominent evangelical publication reported that D'Souza had been spotted at a conference with a woman who was not his wife. He repeatedly introduced her as his fiance, despite the fact that he was still married, and checked into a nearby hotel with her. Court records show that he only even filed for divorce the day that World called him for comment. D'Souza wound up resigning his role as president of King's College. The scandal was complicated by the fact that World's editor-in-chief, Marvin Olasky, had left his role as King's provost upon D'Souza's appointment as president, and the reporter writing the story, Warren Cole Smith, had been a consultant to the school before being let go by D'Souza. The second, much more significant scandal involves payments he made to his mistress who he has since broken up with and her husband, as well as another couple, to reimburse them for donations made to Wendy Long, the longshot Republican nominee running against Kristen Gillibrand for US Senate in New York in 2012. Long was a Dartmouth classmate of D'Souza's and also wrote for the Review. It is illegal to reimburse for donations, since it effectively allows you to give in excess of contribution limits. In this case, D'Souza funneled 20,000 in money through four friends to Long, far above the 5,000 individual contribution limit and that is not even counting the 5,000 he gave her himself D'Souza was caught, and indicted. D'Souza pled guilty to one count of making illegal contributions in the names of others, but has claimed throughout that he is being selectively prosecuted by the Obama administration for his political beliefs. Prosecutors, led by prominent US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, pushed for D'Souza to be sentenced to 10-16 months in federal prison. Judge Richard Berman spared him jail time, sentencing him to eight months in a community confinement center, five years probation, and a 30,000 fine. But Berman categorically rejected the idea that D'Souza was a victim of selective prosecution: \"That is nonsense. Spin is what that is.\" D'Souza served his sentence at a community confinement center in San Diego. He told Fox News' Megyn Kelly during that time that he would check into the center between 7 and 9 pm every night and sleep there, but was otherwise free to do what he likes with his days in general. He was required to stay in the San Diego area for the duration of the sentence, and his media interviews were subject to review by his probation officer.

If D'Souza is no longer accepted by most conservative intellectuals, then he is more than made up for it by making inroads into more conspiracy-oriented conservative circles. His theory of Obama has been embraced by Glenn Beck; InfoWars' Alex Jones brought D'Souza on his show to lament his political persecution by the Obama administration. \"Viewed through the lens of the intelligentsia and the media elite, D'Souza has suffered a tragicomic fall from grace, undone by some combination of conspiratorial thinking, pseudo-academic posturing, and hubris,\" Simon van Zuylen-Wood wrote in a 2013 profile for National Journal. \"But in a separate, larger universe, the onetime rising star is ascendant once again.\" That is even truer now, with Trump leading the conservative movement. Zuylen-Wood notes that this new era in D'Souza's career has been rather profitable, with both of his documentaries earning tens of millions of dollars, and he is been able to generate sales by targeting enemies perceived to be trying to sabotage him. \"D'Souza has mastered the art of turning perceived slights into commercial gain,\" Zuylen-Wood writes. \"When Costco pulled America the book a few months ago, citing poor sales, D'Souza claimed that he was being targeted for political reasons. Costco's CEO is an Obama fundraiser. An AM radio scandal was born. Costco backed down, restocked the title, and D'Souza's books were suddenly more popular than ever.\" Some of D'Souza's bigger provocations, like the selfie tweet or this one: Obama forcefully asserts his position on Beheading pic.twitter.com QbVbvE582d Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza August 29, 2014 play directly to this new audience. So did his sympathetic position on Donald Trump in the primaries: I am not endorsing anyone, but I do relish the frustration befuddlement of the GOP establishment as Trump wins one more time Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza February 24, 2016 For his part, D'Souza told Zuylen-Wood that he did not think his approach changed any from when he was an AEI or Hoover fellow: \"What you should do, Simon, is go back and read Illiberal Education and its tone, and then read the America book and its tone. I do not think there is a fundamental difference in my approach then and now Illiberal Education has been baptized into a sort of pathbreaking, sort of sober, responsible book. It was a bomb when I dropped it in 1991!\" D'Souza has a point. He is been provoking people for provocation's sake since he published an interview with a Klan member accompanied by a doctored photo of a black classmate being lynched. Sometimes he will even admit that is what he is doing: Mediaite I love it when my tweets score a direct hit, measured by the intensity of shrieking on the left Dinesh D'Souza DineshDSouza October 6, 2014 Correction: This post originally referred to World Magazine's editor-in-chief as \"Martin Olasky.\" His first name is Marvin. <doc_sep> Recently pardoned conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza wasted no time before mocking the man who put him away following his full pardon by President Trump on Thursday. \"KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired I got pardoned,\" D'Souza tweeted at Bharara, former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Bharara indicted D'Souza in 2014 for using \"straw donors\" to funnel 20,000 to Wendy Long's 2012 US Senate campaign in New York. D'Souza pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months in a halfway house and five years' probation, along with a 30,000 fine. Trump fired Bharara, appointed by President Barack Obama, after he refused to resign last year. The former prosecutor tweeted earlier Thursday that he stands by the conviction. \"The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job. Period,\" he tweeted. <doc_sep> FILE In this May 20, 2014 file photo, conservative scholar and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, left, accompanied by his lawyer Benjamin Brafman leaves federal court, in New York.

Associated Press WASHINGTON AP The Latest on President Donald Trump's consideration of pardons and sentence commutations all times local 12:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says he is considering commuting the sentence of ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and pardoning Martha Stewart. The comments came aboard Air Force One on Thursday after he announced on Twitter that he planned to pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza. Trump tells reporters that Blagojevich said something dumb but that \"lots of politicians\" do and thinks his sentence is excessive. The Democratic former governor began serving his 14-year prison sentence on corruption convictions in 2012. His scheduled release date is 2024. Blagojevich was also a contestant on Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality television show in 2010. Stewart was convicted in 2004 of obstructing justice and lying to the government about why she unloaded stock just before the price plummeted. Trump says she \"used to be one of my biggest fans.\" _ 10:10 a.m. President Donald Trump says he will pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud. Trump tweeted Thursday: \"Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!\" In 2014, D'Souza was sentenced to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a YOU.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.",

    "document": "Colin Kaepernick's protest of the national anthem has been spreading across the sports world, now a division rival may be embracing it. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane has already joined the protest, and now linebacker Bobby Wagner and receiver Doug Baldwin may join him. In fact, the entire Seahawks roster may sit in solidarity with the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. Wagner said he did not know if he was going to sit but that, \"anything we want to do, it is not going to be individual. It is going to be a team thing. That is what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals.\" When asked if other players on the team have considered joining Lane's protest, Baldwin said, \"our locker room has discussed it. So we will see.\" Baldwin said he has heard from veterans who have supported a series of tweets he posted defending the protest. He had the following to say about it: \"My grandfather being in the military, it hit home for me as well, and specifically it is the veterans. That is more heartening to me than anything is the veterans that have reached out and said that is what they fought for, that is what they sacrificed their lives for, is to give people back home under the flag, under this country, the opportunity to stand up or sit for what they believe in.\" Baldwin also said he has been in contact with Kaepernick over the last few days. Wagner said the Seahawks organization and coaches will not dictate what the players do. \"We have the freedom to do whatever we want here. Whatever we decide to do, we are not going to get into too much trouble. We are big kids now.\" When it closes in on kickoff at CenturyLink Field on Sunday all eyes will be on the Seahawks to see what they decide to do. <doc_sep> At the very least, Colin Kaepernick's decision to kneel for the national anthem has raised awareness about why he is doing it, which he explained last month: \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" Granted, the issue has been a contentious one, and as President Obama pointed out this week, the way Kaepernick has chosen to deliver is message might be \"messy\" but this is how \"democracy works.\" But Kaepernick also is not alone; over the weekend, United States Women's National Team member Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem prior to her club team's game, and fellow NFL player, Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane did the same. Lane says he will continue to sit and he could have company from teammates. Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin is considering following Lane's lead, while linebacker Bobby Wagner said the team has been talking about taking action as a group. Details via the Seattle Times' Bob Condotta: While Wagner said he did not know if he would sit down during the anthem he said \"anything we want to do, it is not going to be individual. It is going to be a team thing. That is what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals.\" Wagner said he could not say exactly what the team might do, saying \"whatever we decide to do will be a big surprise.\" Meanwhile, Lane has the full support of Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. Lane's pretty clear on what he did and what he was trying to express and I think it is very simple and so we will leave that up to him,\" Carroll said. \"But he understands the responsibility of it, I think, and shouldering it.' Wagner added: \"We have the freedom to do whatever we want here. Whatever we decide to do, we are not going to get into too much trouble. We are big kids now.\" And Baldwin said he did not think there would be any issues in the locker room, even if some players disagreed with the idea of sitting during the anthem. \"It is different in our locker room,\" he explained. \"We kind of give each other a lot of slack, so whatever decisions you make, we understand we are all human beings. Some of us might not agree, some of us will agree. But at the same time we give each other slack because we know we are all human beings.\" One person that will not have a problem with Lane or others: Defensive end Michael Bennett. \"I mean I think it is his right to be able to protest,\" Bennett said last week, when Lane first made his stance by sitting. \"And I think it is all right. I think there are definitely some issues in America that a lot of people are starting to recognize. I think people have recognized them before but I think with social media and the things that are going on out there, the media outlets, everybody has a chance to really show what is going on and their ideas and having a chance to really protest what they think is wrong with America and that is OK, that is what it is about. It is about people having that right to have their voice and I think it is cool that Jeremy Lane is doing what he wants to do.\" The Seahawks host the Dolphins on Sunday in the regular-season opener, which just so happens to fall on September 11.",

    "document": "Moe's Southwest Grill has toppled Chipotle to become America's favorite Mexican-inspired fast casual restaurant chain, according to a new poll. The 1,900-unit Chipotle Mexican Grill chain, which had topped the last three annual Harris polls, did not even finish in the top four. The Denver-based chain has been beset by a number of food-borne illnesses in the last year, including a norovirus outbreak that sickened 386 customers, a salmonella incident that sickened 64 people and e. coli episodes in 11 states that sickened 60 people. As a result, sales have decline 30 percent and the company's shares have dipped 33 percent, to 411.14, in early Friday trading. For Moe's, a 600-unit chain, the first place finish in the Harris poll was its first. Moe's showed the largest increase in brand equity 13 percent among all restaurants measured, and demonstrates one of the largest equity increases across all brands assessed, which is significant given the tendency for equity to resist rapid movement. If getting knocked out of the top position was not bad enough for Chipotle executives, then the names of the chains that Americans love more than Chipotle should give them pause: Taco Bell finshed No. 2 in the poll, with Qdoba Mexican Grill coming in third and Baja Fresh Mexican Grill coming in fourth. Harris polled 97,120 US consumers aged 15 and over. <doc_sep> Chipotle Mexican Grill has had a tumultuous year between the bouts of food-borne illnesses and plummeting sales, but it has managed to emerge from the mess of E. coli-related issues. But the pile-on continues as other chains take advantage of the shifting fast-casual market food and begin to climb past the Denver-based chain in customer ratings. Moe's Southwest Grill, which got its start in Atlanta in 2000 and now has more than 600 locations worldwide, is reaping significant benefits from Chipotle's downturn. The chain has been named \"brand of the year\" in the Harris Poll's category of fast-casual Mexican restaurants, unseating Chipotle, which took the top prize for the last three years but failed to even make the top four in 2016. This year, Chipotle was bested by Taco Bell, Qdoba Mexican Grill, and Baja Fresh Mexican Grill. The Harris Poll ranked this year's brands based on more than 97,000 responses from United States customers, and Moe's was praised for its willingness to listen and respond to diner feedback and needs. \"We really view the competition as share of stomach,\" Moe's president Bruce Schroder said previously. Moe's is part of Focus Brands Inc., which operates chains such as Carvel, Cinnabon, and Auntie Anne's Pretzels, among others. On February 8, when Chipotle closed all of its restaurants for a food safety self-check, Moe's took out a full-page ad in USA Today to emphasize its openness. Overall, Moe's has seen a 5 percent increase in foot traffic thanks in part to Chipotle's struggles, according to a Placed survey. Chipotle still has some loyalists, however, such as the Washington man who is working toward his goal of eating a meal from the chain 366 days in a row. <doc_sep> CLOSE Harris Poll named Moe's the Brand of the Year for fast casual Mexican restaurants, ending Chipotle's three year run as their 1 chain. Moe's Southwest Grill has unseated Chipotle as fast casual Mexican restaurant \"Brand of the Year,\" according to an annual Harris Poll. Photo: Moe's Southwest Grill People with a hankering for a burrito are no longer beelining for Chipotle first. Or second, or third, or fourth. Moe's Southwest Grill, a Tex-Mex chain with less than half the number of locations as Chipotle, has unseated the former fast casual king as the most popular brand selling Mexican-inspired food, according to an annual survey out Thursday from Harris Poll that measures how people feel about restaurant brands. Moe's has more than 650 restaurants to Chipotle's more than 1,900. Moe's, which is owned by the same company that operates shopping mall mainstays Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon, claimed the \"Brand of the Year\" title for fast casual Mexican restaurants for the first time, while Chipotle fell hard. The No. 1 pick for the past three years, it is now ranked below not only Moe's but Taco Bell, Qdoba and Baja Fresh. The survey is yet another sign of the harsh impact Chipotle's food-safety issues have had on the brand in the past year. Chipotle has been grasping at a former semblance of its reputation as a purveyor of fresh food in the months since dealing with multiple incidences of E. Coli and norovirus at restaurants across the country. Sales tanked, a rude awakening for a brand that had been wildly popularity for years. The company has said customers are coming back around though, and has tried to lure customers back with offers for free burritos and buy one, get one deals. In the first quarter, sales at stores open at least a year fell nearly 30 though the company said transaction volume improved as the quarter went on. A free burrito offer in February had a 67 redemption rate. But beyond Chipotle's issues, the fast casual restaurant landscape has also become more competitive as chains have gone head to head to offer customers healthier food and new menu options. Qdoba rolled out a new taco menu last year with fillings like tequila lime chicken, steak and bacon; Taco Bell has gained prominence for its breakfast menu and started selling alcohol in some restaurants last year. Moe's is known for a wide selection of ingredients for build-your-own tacos, quesadillas and burrito bowls the brand also frequently offers limited time menu additions, such as an ancho chili lime rice bowl and seasonal salsas like ghost pepper and mango tomatillo. Chipotle, meanwhile, has rarely introduced new menu items, and some say the company has not done enough to show customers its food is safe to eat, even though it has adopted new food safety protocols. \"Their sales have been under tremendous pressure,\" says Andrew Charles, an equity research analyst with Cowen and Co. who follows both Chipotle and Qdoba. \"Brand perception is down. In retrospect, I just do not think they did enough to convince customers that Chipotle food was safe to eat,\" pointing out that there are no signs in stores alerting customers to the changes and announcements on social media have been scarce. Moe's rose to the top for ranking the highest in familiarity, quality and purchase consideration. Harris Poll surveyed more than 97,000 YOU.S. consumers for their thoughts on more than 3,800 brands, including more than 60 restaurants. Each respondent was given a list of 40 randomly selected brands to rate. Moe's has benefited from a rapid expansion in recent years, which has given the brand a stronger position as a Chipotle alternative, says Lisa Recoussine, vice president of client services at Nielsen, which owns Harris Poll. Moe's opened 70 new restaurants last year, when sales hit nearly 640 million. To be sure, Chipotle still has much larger market share and sales, which were 4.5 billion in 2015. According to Placed Insights, an analytics firm that measures traffic trends, just 2.3 of the YOU.S. population visited a Moe's last month, while nearly 9.4 visited a Chipotle. Though the poll results show Moe's may be poised to steal more customers, says David Shim, CEO of Placed Insights. \"Moe's has an opportunity to continue to convert that brand equity into restaurant visits,\" Shim says, \"closing the visitation gap with Chipotle.\" Read or Share this story: http: usat.ly 1tdDDKc",

Competition in the category has been fierce, with Mexican eateries all trying to one-up each other in serving up healthier menu items with more selection. USA Today notes that Moe's is especially known for the ample variety of ingredients used to create build-your-own tacos, burritos, and other fare. But it is almost as if Chipotle gave up, debuting few new menu items and taking a halfhearted approach to alerting consumers to steps it is taken to address the hundreds of illnesses-the New York Post helpfully documents the norovirus, E. coli, and salmonella count-that have resulted from chowing down its food. \"I just do not think they did enough to convince customers that Chipotle food was safe to eat,\" an equity research analyst tells USA Today.

Prosecutors say the crimes were carried out over several months inside the man's apartment. The allegations are shocking enough, but the man we are talking about was a student at Michigan State University, studying to be a doctor. 24 year old Andrew David Thompson was formally charged with ten counts of killing and torturing an animal. He is also charged with one count of abandoning and cruelty to one animal. Prosecutors say they are still investigating and more charges are likely to follow. Thompson lived in the Berry Tree apartment complex. It is located in Meridian Township just off Mount Hope near Hagadorn Road. Prosecutors say it is where Thompson brought dogs over the past several months and killed them. They say someone called police which led officers to execute a search warrant of Thompson's apartment and eventually make the arrest. Neighbors say they are shocked to learn of the allegations.

During the campaign, CNN's KFile surfaced demeaning comments Trump made about women on the show. Stern said he considers Trump a friend, but is opposed to his politics. \"I like Donald very much personally. I was shocked when he decided to run for president, and even more shocked that sort of, people took it seriously,\" Stern said. \"I remember saying to him when he announced his presidency, I remember being quite amazed, because I remember him being for Hillary Clinton,\" Stern added. \"And I remember him being very-I mean he was pro-abortion. So the new Donald Trump kind of surprised me.\" Stern said he does not believe Trump has had a change of heart on issues like abortion, but is instead playing to his base. The radio host said he also believed Trump ran for president solely to get a larger contract from NBC for \"The Apprentice.\" \"I think it started out as like a kind of cool, fun thing to do in order to get a couple more bucks out of NBC for The Apprentice, I actually do believe that,\" Stern said. \"He just wanted a couple more bucks out of NBC, and that is why Donald is calling for voter fraud investigations.

Questioning the sincerity of Trump's shift to the other end of the political spectrum, Stern added, \"I do not believe that, for example now, that he is had some sort of rethink on abortion and all this. I think he is sort of playing it to his constituency, which is this religious right.\" Stern also addressed Trump's recent feuding with the entertainment industry and the media. \"He is now on this anti-Hollywood kick,\" Stern said.

    "document": "JOHNS CREEK, Ga. A promising start turned into a shocking disappointment Thursday for Tiger Woods, who made three double bogeys at Atlanta Athletic Club on his way to a 77 during the first round of the PGA Championship. Tiger Woods shared the lead at 3-under early Thursday, then struggled to a 77. Daniel Shirey US Presswire The 7-over-par total left Woods tied for 129th place, well behind first-round leader Steve Stricker, who shot a 63, matching a major championship record. For Woods, who has won 14 major titles, it was among his worst performances. \"I am not down, I am just very angry right now,\" Woods said after shooting his highest opening round in a major championship and highest ever at the PGA. \"I thought I could play by feel, see the shot, hit the shot. I am not at that point yet.\" Woods started nicely Thursday morning, rolling in a birdie putt at the 10th hole his first then adding birdies at the 12th and 14th holes. At 3-under par through his first five holes, Woods was tied for the early lead. But he lost five shots against par on the next four holes, with double bogeys at the 15th and 18th. Tiger added five more bogeys on the front nine, including his third double bogey of the day, at No. 6. Woods, who tees off at 1:45 p.m. ET on Friday, is now in danger of seeing his PGA Tour season come to an early end. Woods has never missed the cut in 13 previous PGA Championships, but if he fails to finish among the top 70 and ties, he will be headed home for the weekend. And that means he might not be seen again this year on the PGA Tour. Woods, 35, is 129th in FedEx Cup points and needs to be among the top 125 through next week's Wyndham Championship in order to advance to the first of four playoff events in two weeks. <doc_sep> Tiger Woods staggers to an opening 77 at PGA Championship JOHNS CREEK, Ga. One hour after he started, Tiger Woods was atop the leaderboard Thursday at the PGA Championship and felt like the Tiger of old. He never imagined he would end up with his worst score ever in the opening round of a major. He opened with three birdies in five holes. He followed with three double bogeys over the next 10 holes. Woods started out with his name high on the board, right next to Steve Stricker, who went on to tie a major championship record with 63. He wound up toward the bottom, next to John Daly and 57-year-old Jerry Pate, with a 77. It was his highest round in a major since Woods shot an 81 in the vicious wind and pelting rain of Muirfield in the third round of the British Open nine years ago. And it was no mystery to him how it all happened. \"Got off to a great start today, was 3 under early, was having mechanical thoughts through those holes and I thought, 'I can let it go' and play by instinct and feel,\" he said. \"And it just screwed up my whole round. I am not at that point where I can do that yet.\" Woods returned to competition last week and completed his first tournament since the Masters, staying away from golf until he was certain that injuries to his left leg would no longer because him trouble. The head not to mention his swing still have plenty of work. Looking serious as ever when he walked onto the putting green to begin warming up, dressed in a deep coral shirt and blank pants, close to a Sunday look. Then came an 18-foot birdie putt on the opening hole, No. 10, an aggressive 5-wood from a blind shot in the pine straw on the par-5 12th, followed by a bunker shot from a plugged lie to 3 feet for another birdie. He hammered a drive more than 300 yards in the air on the 14th, leaving him a wedge to 3 feet for another birdie. \"He is back!\" a fan cried out from behind the green as Woods approached. Not quite. It was the highest opening round for Woods in any tournament since he shot 79 at the Australian Open in 1996. He is due to play Down Under again in November. At this rate, that might be his next tournament. Not since the final round at Bay Hill in 2007 had Woods made at least three double bogeys in one round. He started this carnage with a 4-iron on the 254-yard 15th hole that did not look awful until it landed, just to the right of the green and into the pond. On the 18th, his tee shot flew into the bunker with such force that it buried into the side of the sand, and he did well to get it out sideways to the fairway. But he missed his target by some 30 yards on the next shot, into another bunker, and took another double bogey. His final double bogey came from a fairway bunker at No. 6, a shot he knew was bad as soon as he hit it. It landed in the middle of the pound, and then it was a matter of limiting the damage. He finished with a bogey from the bunker. Woods was in the sand a dozen times. He has talked about going back to his old swing while trying to learn a new one, and he said that was the case Thursday. \"And that is what is frustrating,\" Woods said. \"I thought I was playing well enough that I do not have to do that. I can just go out and there play and let it go and just play by feel see the shot, hit the shot, feel it. And I am not at that point yet. My same motor patterns get in there. I start fighting it and I could not get it back.\" Woods might not have much time left. He is No. 129 in the standings for the FedEx Cup playoffs that start in two weeks. If he misses the cut Friday he has only done that twice in the majors he would not be eligible for any PGA Tour events for six weeks.

Much of his game was spent in water and on sand, with three double-bogeys and five bogeys, the AP reports. \"I am not down,\" he said afterward. \"I am really angry right now.\" The struggle came after a strong start: After the first five holes, Woods was tied for first. But double-bogeys at the 15th, 18th, and 6th holes helped leave him with the fifth-worst score. Now, his PGA Tour season could end tomorrow; it would be the first time he would ever missed the PGA cut, ESPN notes. Maybe he is still adjusting to his new caddie?

Associated Press Republican YOU.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore talks to the media as he arrives to vote, Tuesday, December 12, 2017, in Gallant, Ala. Alabama voters are deciding between Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and Democrat Doug Jones. AP Photo Brynn Anderson Associated Press BIRMINGHAM, Ala. AP The Latest on Alabama's YOU.S. Senate election all times local 9:24 p.m. CST Democrat Doug Jones has won election to the YOU.S. Senate from Alabama, dealing a political blow to President Donald Trump. Jones has defeated Republican Roy Moore, a one-time GOP pariah who was embraced by the Republican Party and the president even after facing allegations of sexual impropriety. An attorney and former prosecutor, Jones rallied voters on a message of moving past the Moore controversies. He was buoyed by an influx of national Democratic cash and endorsements. Jones' victory is set to narrow the slim Republican majority over Democrats in the Senate to 51-49. His win in the Republican stronghold energizes the Democratic Party as it looks to build on anti-Trump sentiment to mount a challenge next year to Republican control of Congress. _ 8:40 p.m. Republican Roy Moore has briefly greeted an optimistic crowd at his election night party in Montgomery, Alabama. Moore shook hands with supporters after they chanted, \"Judge Roy Moore.\" He then left to watch returns in another room. His campaign manager told the crowd that Moore would soon have the new title of senator. With about half the vote counted, the Alabama Senate race between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones is too close to call. Moore is looking for support in rural areas and party loyalty from Republicans to carry him to victory. Jones is attempting to become the first Alabama Democrat elected to the YOU.S. Senate in 25 years. _ 7:10 p.m. Republican Roy Moore's supporters are expressing optimism as polls close in Alabama. Supporters filed into Moore's election night party in Montgomery shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. \"Watch party? It is a victory party,\" Moore campaign manager Rich Hobson told the crowd. Becky Gerritson, the leader of a nearby tea party group, says sexual misconduct allegations against Moore have caused his supporters to rally around him harder. \"We are seeing his supporters digging in and they are pumped up,\" Gerritson said. Reporters at Moore's election night party were kept behind a barricade in the back of the ballroom. _ 7 p.m. Polls are closed in Alabama in the race to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At time of national reckoning over long-suppressed misconduct by powerful men, the choice between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones has taken on outsized significance. Moore has faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers, dividing the GOP and giving Democrats hope of picking up a seat in a reliably red state. President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee broke with top congressional leaders in standing by Moore despite the accusations, wagering that maintaining the seat in the Republican stronghold was of paramount importance. Democrats are hoping to break their 0-5 streak in special elections for Republican-held seats in 2017, and looking for momentum heading into the 2018 midterm elections. _ 4:30 p.m. Alabama Republican Roy Moore's campaign says The Washington Post is not being let into his election night gathering in Montgomery. The Post first reported the allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore. Moore campaign spokeswoman Hannah Ford confirmed the newspaper is not being granted press credentials. The campaign told the newspaper it had reviewed its request and was denying them. Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in Tuesday's election for a YOU.S. Senate seat. _ 3:45 p.m. There are signs of heightened security at Republican Roy Moore's election night gathering in the Alabama race for YOU.S. Senate. Men in SWAT uniforms videoed the exterior of the building where Moore's party is being held in Montgomery. Campaign spokeswoman Hannah Ford said the campaign had previously received threats. Earlier Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security official said the agency is keeping an eye on the election. The agency's top infrastructure and cybersecurity official said a federal protective security adviser and a cybersecurity adviser are in Montgomery and working \"side by side\" with state government officials in case issues arise. _ 2 p.m. The Department of Homeland Security is keeping its eye on Alabama's special YOU.S. Senate election. The agency's top infrastructure and cybersecurity official says a federal protective security adviser and a cybersecurity adviser are in the capital city of Montgomery and working \"side by side\" with state government officials in case issues arise. Christopher Krebs says he is not aware of any specific threats. But he says DHS has been working with the state \"for quite some time\" to prepare for any issues. It is part of a larger effort to better share threat information and provide technical support after DHS concluded Russian government hackers targeted election systems in 21 states last year. Krebs says: \"We learned our lessons last year.\" _ 1:55 p.m. Voter turnout appears heavier than expected in one of Alabama's most reliably Republican counties in the YOU.S. Senate election, and officials say they are not just seeing the usual GOP crowd. Shelby County Probate Judge Jim Fuhrmeister says turnout appears higher than normal among young people and black voters in Tuesday's balloting. That could help Democrat Doug Jones against Republican Roy Moore. Democrats have a table outside one of the county's largest voting precincts in Helena, and volunteers from the Jones campaign are canvassing neighborhoods in normally Republican areas. Fuhrmeister says he is not predicting a Democratic win, but he expects the party to see some results for its efforts. Shelby County, just south of Birmingham, is one of Alabama's most affluent counties. _ 11:50 a.m. Republican candidate Roy Moore rode his horse to the polls as he is done in past elections to cast his ballot in the YOU.S. Senate race. Moore was accompanied by his wife Kayla Moore, also on horseback, as he voted at a rural fire station in the northeast Alabama community of Gallant on Tuesday. Dozens of members of the media surrounded the couple, making it difficult for them to get through on their horses. Moore spoke briefly to reporters, talking in generalities and not discussing allegations that he sexually molested teenage girls decades ago. Moore expressed confidence that he will win. He also said that after the election will be the time to discuss whether he is allowed to take a seat in the Senate. _ 11:15 a.m. YOU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he cast an absentee ballot in Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama but declined to specify his choice, saying he \"valued the sanctity of the ballot.\" At a Tuesday news conference in Baltimore on gang violence and immigration, Sessions said Alabama residents are \"good and decent and wonderful\" people. He said he is confident they will make the right decision. Alabama voters are deciding between Republican Roy Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, and Democrat Doug Jones, a lawyer who prosecuted two Ku Klux Klansmen who killed four black girls in a 1963 church bombing. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore denies the accusations. The winner of Tuesday's election will take the seat previously held by Sessions. _ 8:55 a.m. Democratic nominee Doug Jones was met by cheering supporters as he cast his ballot in Alabama's YOU.S. Senate race. Jones smiled and waved as he arrived at his voting precinct in the wealthy Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook on Tuesday. Poll workers at the church where he voted complained that so many news reporters were on hand that voters were having a hard time parking. Jones says he feels good about the campaign he is run and he does not think Republican Roy Moore is going to win. Jones said, \"This is an important time in Alabama's history, and we feel very confident where we are and how this is going to turn out.\" _ 8:25 a.m. Alabama's top election official estimates that turnout for the hotly contested YOU.S. Senate election now underway will likely be around 18 to 20 percent of registered voters. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill tells The Associated Press there is also a chance that turnout for the special election could be as high as 25 percent. Voting places opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will remain open until 7 p.m. Cool temperatures were common across Alabama when voting began and the state is expected to see dry weather all day during voting. Republican Roy Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in Tuesday's election. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is now 70 and denies the charges. _ 7:45 a.m. More than two dozen people stood in line in the chilly morning air at Legion Field, a predominantly black precinct in Birmingham, after polls opened at 7 a.m. Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones have both reached out to minority voters during their contentious campaign for a YOU.S. Senate seat. Political observers believe that Jones needs heavy turnout among African-American voters in order to win on Tuesday. The Legion Field precinct is in a stadium office, where blue-tinted posters of local college football players and cheerleaders lined one of the walls. About 20 Doug Jones campaign signs were planted in the ground near the parking lot where voters were driving in to vote. There were no Roy Moore signs. _ 7 a.m. Polls have opened across Alabama in the state's closely watched YOU.S. Senate election, which has drawn national attention. Voting places opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will remain open until 7 p.m. Cool temperatures were common across Alabama shortly before voting began and the state is expected to see dry weather all day during Tuesday's voting.

The controversies surrounding Republican Roy Moore give Democrat Doug Jones an opening in the GOP-dominated state. Polls open Tuesday morning. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct with teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is now 70 and denies the charges. He is telling voters they know his character already. Jones is saying decency must prevail. He is urging Alabama voters to see the race as a crossroads with an opportunity to avoid repeating past mistakes that harm the state's image. No Democrat has won an Alabama Senate seat since 1992. That was Sen. Richard Shelby. He is now a Republican who says he did not vote for Moore.",

    "document": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Nazis ran death camps in Poland during the brutal 1939-45 occupation Poland has summoned the US ambassador and demanded an apology over comments on the Holocaust by FBI director James Comey. The foreign ministry said Mr Comey had suggested in a Washington Post article that some Poles were accomplices. After the summons US envoy Stephen Mull said he made it clear the US believed \"Nazi Germany alone\" was responsible. Six million Polish citizens were killed by the Nazis during World War Two, half of them Jewish. 'Falsification of history' In the Washington Post article on Thursday, aimed at raising education about the Holocaust, Mr Comey wrote: \"In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. \"They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.\" The words sparked a storm of protest in Poland. Image copyright AFP Image caption James Comey made the comments in a Washington Post article on Thursday President Bronislaw Komorowski told Polish television the comments were an \"insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews\". Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said: \"To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War Two. I would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter.\" Ambassador Mull, who on Sunday attended ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising against the Nazis, said that any suggestion that \"Poland, or any other countries other than Nazi Germany, bear responsibility for the Holocaust, is a mistake, harmful and insulting\". After Sunday's summons he added: \"I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. \"Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility. I now have a lot of work before me to make things right in this situation.\" But Mr Mull also said he believed the wider message of the article was that many people had either aided the Nazis or not done enough in response to the atrocities, including in the US. The Washington Post on Sunday published a column criticising Mr Comey's comments. The Nazis ran death camps in Poland during the brutal 1939-45 occupation. Correction 20 April 2015: In an earlier version of this report, comments made by the Polish ambassador to Washington were incorrectly attributed to Stephen Mull. <doc_sep> FBI Director James Comey Cliff Owen Associated Press The Polish ambassador to Washington has protested, the Polish president has protested, the speaker of the Polish parliament to whom I am married has protested and the YOU.S. ambassador to Warsaw has apologized profusely. Why? Because James Comey, the director of the FBI, in a speech that was reprinted in The Post arguing for more Holocaust education, demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself. In two poorly worded sentences, he sounded to Polish readers as if he were repeating the World War II myth that most drives them crazy: Namely, that somehow, those who lived in occupied Eastern Europe shared full responsibility for a German policy. Comey put it like this: \"In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.\" There are a number of problems with that pair of weak sentences, starting with the vast difference between Germany and the rest. During the war, Germany had a state policy of exterminating the Jews. This policy involved not \"accomplices\" but hundreds of bureaucrats, tens of thousands of soldiers, train schedules and plans. Germany also encouraged the creation of collaborationist governments in other countries Vichy France, for example some of which used their own police officers to send their Jewish citizens into the German death camps. Germany also occupied Poland, but there was no Polish \"Vichy.\" During the war, there was no Polish state at all. Indeed, it was the absence of the Polish state that enabled the Germans to create a lawless, violent world, one in which anyone could be arbitrarily murdered, any Jew could be deported and any Pole who helped a Jew could be shot instantly, along with his entire family. Many were. Millions of others died too Polish intellectuals, priests and politicians were all Nazi targets. In the course of the war, most of Poland's infrastructure, industry and architecture were destroyed. In that atmosphere, many people were frightened by or indifferent to the fate of the Jews, and some murdered in order to avoid being murdered. But that does not mean that \"in their minds\" they \"did not do something evil.\" Although the circumstances were different, Germany's leading role is equally clear in Hungary. The wartime government of Adm. Mikls Horthy did pass anti-Semitic legislation and did align itself with the Nazis. But the mass murder and deportation of the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz began only in March 1944, when that government dissolved and was replaced with a straightforward German occupation. Once the Hungarian state had been dissolved, in other words, Hungary also became a lawless, violent zone where anything was possible. So no, it is not true, as Comey made it sound, that \"murderers and accomplices\" in Germany, Poland and Hungary and lots of other places were somehow responsible for the Holocaust. And no, it is not true that the Holocaust is a story of so many otherwise \"good\" people who \"convinced themselves it was the right thing to do.\" On the contrary, it is a story about the power of fear, the danger of lawlessness and the horror that was made possible by a specific form of German state terror in the years between 1939 and 1945 a terror that convinced many people to do things that they knew were terribly, terribly wrong. If the FBI director wants to take some lessons from Washington's excellent Holocaust museum, that is very admirable. But first he should make sure he is understood what he is seen. <doc_sep> Visitors to the United States Holocaust Museum pass beneath a cast taken from the original entrance to the Auschwitz death camp, inscribed with the phrase Arbeit Macht Frei Work Makes One Free Bill O'Leary WASHINGTON POST The writer is director of the FBI. This commentary is adapted from a speech given Wednesday at the YOU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's 2015 National Tribute Dinner. I believe that the Holocaust is the most significant event in human history. And I mean \"significant\" in two different ways. It is, of course, significant because it was the most horrific display in world history of inhumanity, one that simply defies words and challenges meaning. I was born into an Irish Catholic family in this great, wonderful and safe country, but the Holocaust has always haunted me, and it has long stood as a stumbling block to faith. How could such a thing be? How is that consistent with the concept of a loving God? How is that in any way reconcilable with the notion of a God with a role in human history? How could there possibly be meaning in life, when so many lives were snuffed out in such a fashion? I have asked those questions since I was a young teenager. I have asked them my entire life. I asked the same questions standing in the pit at Ground Zero in early 2002. I have asked those questions many times as I have confronted unimaginable suffering and loss. And I know I am in good company asking such questions. Last month, on a flight home from Eastern Europe, I reread Viktor Frankl's wrenching \"Man's Search for Meaning,\" in which he seeks to find meaning in suffering and loving, among other things. And going much farther back, back before I was a religious studies major in college, I recalled the voice from the whirlwind in the Book of Job, rebuking us for even asking the question \"Why?\" \"How dare you!\" the voice seems to say. \"It is not for you to ask, it is not for you to know.\" And yet I ask, as so many of us do. And I still do not know. But I do know this: I know it is our duty, our obligation, to make sure some good comes from unimaginable bad. Not so we can comfort ourselves by saying, \"Oh, that was worth it then.\" That is nonsense. That would be perverse. It will never be \"worth it.\" Instead, I believe it is simply our duty to do that, and I believe this is truth no matter where you come from on a philosophical or religious spectrum. Our obligation is to refuse to let bad win, to refuse to let evil hold the field. As Abraham Lincoln said on a field of unimaginable pain and loss, it is essential \"that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\" Our resolution does not justify the loss, but we simply cannot be alive and give up. There are so many ways to fight evil to ensure it does not hold the field. Some do this through public service that can involve actual physical battles against evil; others by different kinds of service, including the service of teaching a world what happened, teaching a world what is true. The Holocaust was, as I said, the most horrific display in world history of inhumanity. But it was also the most horrific display in world history of our humanity, of our capacity for evil and for moral surrender. And that second significance is the reason I require every new FBI special agent and intelligence analyst to go to the Holocaust Museum. Naturally, I want them to learn about abuse of authority on a breathtaking scale. But I want them to confront something more painful and more dangerous: I want them to see humanity and what we are capable of. I want them to see that, although this slaughter was led by sick and evil people, those sick and evil leaders were joined by, and followed by, people who loved their families, took soup to a sick neighbor, went to church and gave to charity. Good people helped murder millions. And that is the most frightening lesson of all that our very humanity made us capable of, even susceptible to, surrendering our individual moral authority to the group, where it can be hijacked by evil. Of being so cowed by those in power. Of convincing ourselves of nearly anything. In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places did not do something evil. They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That is what people do. And that should truly frighten us. That is why I send our agents and our analysts to the Holocaust Museum. I want them to stare at us and realize our capacity for rationalization and moral surrender. I want them to walk out of that great museum treasuring the constraint and oversight of divided government, the restriction of the rule of law, the binding of a free and vibrant press. I want them to understand that all of this is necessary as a check on us because of the way we are. We must build it, we must know it and we must nurture it now, so that it can save us later. That is the only path to the responsible exercise of power.",

    "document": "Almost three days to the minute after he lost a High Court bid to overturn a conviction against him, self-styled sheikh Man Haron Monis took 17 people hostage in the heart of Sydney's legal precinct. Shortly before 9.50am last Friday, the court had dealt a blow to Monis' long-running legal battle to overturn his conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. At 9.45am on Monday, police were called to an unfolding siege at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place, metres from the Law Courts Building in Phillip Street where Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler had refused an application by Monis to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him. Monis was dead just under 17 hours later. So too were two hostages who were taken to hospital after an exchange of gunfire at the cafe just after 2am on Tuesday. Monis had been consumed by the fight over his conviction for sending the offensive letters. Advertisement \"This pen is my gun, and these words are my bullets,\" he had said outside a Sydney court after he was charged over the letters. \"I will fight with these weapons against oppression to promote peace.\" In August last year, he had reluctantly pleaded guilty to using a postal service to send the \"harassing or offensive\" letters to the grieving families of the soldiers as well as the family of an Austrade official killed in Indonesia. But this was not before he fought the validity of the charges all the way to the High Court, arguing the offence in the Criminal Code infringed the implied freedom of communication on political and governmental matters in the Commonwealth constitution. Monis claimed the letters were his own version of a \"condolence card\" or \"flower basket\" and he only sought to persuade the families to oppose Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan. When the High Court handed down its ruling in February last year, it was split three-three on the issue and so it was bound to uphold an earlier, unanimous, decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal that the charges against him were constitutionally valid. Chief Justice French and Justices Kenneth Hayne and Dyson Heydon would have ruled in Monis' favour but Justices Susan Crennan, Susan Kiefel and Virginia Bell would have dismissed his case. When Monis lost that battle, and had to stand trial for the offences, he pleaded guilty to all 12 charges against him. He escaped a prison sentence the maximum penalty is two years behind bars and was sentenced instead to 300 hours of community service and placed on a good behaviour bond for the \"offensive and deplorable letters\". His co-accused and girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting him. But Monis fought on. On Friday, the 50-year-old's legal team, led by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds, SC, asked the High Court to hear the constitutional issue again because the court had been split down the middle on the issue. \"Here, of course, there are special circumstances because of the three-three split,\" Mr Reynolds told the court shortly after it convened in Sydney at 9.30am. Mr Reynolds argued that an even split meant \"no principle or precedent\" was established in the earlier case brought on Monis' behalf in the High Court. \"If it was four-three, I would be in the position of having a precedent against me,\" Mr Reynolds said. Chief Justice French and Justice Gageler were not persuaded. \"In our opinion it suffices to say that, having regard to the history of the matter, we do not think it appropriate to make the order sought to hear the case The application will be dismissed,\" Chief Justice French said. Monis heard the result of the case late on Friday, and took a gun into Martin Place on Monday. It is an irony that Monis was incensed by a conviction that resulted in a mere 300 hours of community service. At the time of the siege, he was on bail in relation to two separate and serious cases that could have seen him imprisoned for decades. He was charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact to the murder of his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed and set alight in a Werrington apartment block. Droudis has been charged with the murder. And this year, Monis was charged by sex crimes squad detectives with more than 40 indecent and sexual assault charges relating to his time spent as a self-proclaimed \"spiritual healer\". <doc_sep> Monis had conviction for sending offensive letters to relatives of Australian victims of terrorism and troops killed in Afghanistan Until his entry into the global media spotlight as the shadowy figure at the centre of the Sydney siege, Man Haron Monis had long been viewed as a fringe figure in Sydney's Islamic community, his self-radicalisation rooted in grievances against the Australian government and increasing marginalisation among his peers. The self-proclaimed spiritual healer had achieved a degree of notoriety as the author of \"grossly offensive\" letters sent to taunt parents and relatives of Australians killed by extremism in Indonesia as well as troops who lost their lives in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009. Well known to the Australian police, he had been consumed by his conviction for the offence, unsuccessfully challenging the conviction in the high court last year and making several vehement and erratic public statements claiming to be innocent. Monis lost another bid to have the matter heard before the high court on Friday. He also faced numerous charges relating to his time working as a \"spiritual healer\" including 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault and had been bailed for allegedly being an accessory to the killing of his former wife. When Monis, who was also known as Mohammad Hassan Manteghi, appeared in court in October over the sex assault allegations, police charged him with 40 additional offences. It was alleged that he had advised a 27-year-old woman to visit him at his business in Wentworthville in 2002 after she contacted him through a \"Spiritual Consultation\" ad in a community newspaper. He was charged last year with being an accessory to the murder of his 30-year-old former wife Noleen Hayson Pal, a mother-of-two who was allegedly stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013. Iranian-born, Monis sought asylum in Australia in 1996, telling ABC News in 2001 he fled after falling foul of the Iranian regime, which he said had placed his wife and children under house arrest. \"I can say they are hostage,\" he said at the time, having reportedly given himself the title Sheikh Haron. As recently as last week on a website he used both to defend and promote himself, he announced that he had converted from Shia to Sunni Islam and pledged his allegiance to the caliphate declared by the militant group Islamic State. That website was shut down as Monday's siege developed, and police asked media outlets to refrain from giving him a platform as he held 17 hostages in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place. Sydney Shia leaders had apparently urged federal police to probe his claim to be a leading cleric, while he was ignored by the Sunni community. He had no links to the Islamic State terrorist group, and despite his criminal past was not seen as a likely exponent of the group's ideology. One upshot, some would argue, is that he fits bill of a classic lone wolf a profile that had been much feared by security officials. Monis is believed to have been a self-starter, who had attached himself to the virulent worldview of Isis. His self-radicalisation appeared to be rooted in grievances against the government and fueled by his increasing marginalisation. Earlier this month, Monis had posted on his website that Shia muslims were rejectionists a key message of extremist Sunnis in the Middle East. But there were other hints on the web post that Monis had become radicalised: a rambling October letter he penned to the Muslim community rejected the \"new religion\" of moderate Islam. 'This pen is my gun and these words are my bullets, I fight by these weapons against oppression to promote peace,' he wrote. An image on the website appears to show Monis wearing the same headband that photographs suggest he donned during the Martin Place siege, reading: \"We are ready to sacrifice for you, O Muhammad.\" Shortly after Tony Abbott's government was elected in September last year, Monis sent the prime minister a letter inviting him to a live debate in which he said he would prove that \"Australia and Australians will be attacked\" as a result of the country's participation in the war in Afghanistan. Manny Conditsis, a lawyer who represented Monis at one point, has decribed his former client as an isolated figure who might have felt that he had nothing to lose, \"hence participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this\". \"His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,\" Conditsis told ABC news. <doc_sep> Sydney siege: Man behind Martin Place stand-off was Iranian Man Haron Monis, who had violent criminal history Updated The gunman killed during the siege at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place was an Iranian cleric with a violent criminal past. Man Haron Monis, who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001, was on bail for a string of violent offences, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He was also facing more than 50 sexual and indecent assault charges and had a conviction for sending abusive letters to families of deceased Australian soldiers. Police negotiated with Monis, via hostages, for 16 hours on Monday before officers stormed the building at 2:00am AEDT on Tuesday. He entered the cafe about 9:45am AEDT on Monday and held 17 staff and customers inside throughout the day. Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed more about Monis' background in his press briefing this morning. What we do know is that the perpetrator was well known to State and Commonwealth authorities. He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. We know that he sent offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was found guilty of offences related to this. We also know that he posted graphic extremist material online. As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult. His former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the ABC that Monis was an isolated figure who had acted alone. Do you know more about this story? Email investigations abc.net.au. \"He came to Australia in the late 1990s as I understand it, obtained political asylum in 2001. He fled Iran because he was in fear of his life from the regime at that time,\" Mr Conditsis told ABC News Breakfast. \"Monis personally faced charges as a result of writing letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers. \"They were dealt with in 2013. Subsequent to that he was charged with accessory before and after the fact in relation to the murder of his former spouse. Eventually he got bail. \"I appeared for him in December of 2013 when he obtained bail essentially based on a case that was presented by the prosecution at the time. It had significant weaknesses in it. I think that had a significant impact on him getting bail at that time.\" More recently, he was charged with more than 50 allegations of indecent and sexual assault. Police allege the assaults took place in 2002, when Monis was a self-proclaimed \"spiritual healer\" operating out of premises in Wentworthville. It is alleged that Monis placed ads in local newspapers offering \"spiritual consultation\". He claimed to be an expert in astrology, numerology, meditation and black magic. But it was Monis' ongoing legal battle over his conviction for sending offensive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers between 2007 and 2009 that may have tipped him over the edge. The siege followed an unsuccessful, last-ditch attempt in the High Court to have the charges overturned. Monis was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and placed on a two-year good behaviour bond for the \"offensive and deplorable letters\" sent with the help of his girlfriend Amirah Droudis. They were sent to the families of Private Luke Worsley and Lance Corporal Jason Marks, who were killed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. He also sent a letter in 2009 to the family of the Austrade official Craig Senger, who was killed in the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2007. Monis claimed the letters were his own version of a \"flower basket\" or \"condolence card\". He challenged the validity of the charges in the High Court, arguing they were political. But he lost and at trial, pleaded guilty to all 12 charges against him in August 2013. Mr Conditsis represented Monis last year when he was charged with being accessory to the murder of ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed and set alight outside a western Sydney unit. \"Knowing he was on bail for very serious offences, knowing that while he was in custody some terrible things happened to him, I thought he may consider that he is got nothing to lose,\" he said. \"Hence participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He said Monis claimed to have suffered poor treatment while in prison. \"He was put through let us say some very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" he said. Mr Conditsis said the public could be assured the siege was not the work of an organised terrorist group. \"This was a one-off random individual,\" he said. \"It was not a concerted terrorism event or act. \"It was a damaged-goods individual who did something outrageous.\" Topics: islam, religion-and-beliefs, community-and-society, law-crime-and-justice, sydney-2000 First posted <doc_sep> Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Australian PM Tony Abbott: \"We do have to ask ourselves the question could it have been prevented?\" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned why the gunman in the Sydney cafe siege was not on the country's terror watch list. He said the government would examine why Man Haron Monis had been on bail. Mr Abbott paid tribute to the two hostages who died in Monday's siege, describing them as \"good people\". The two hostages and Monis died as police commandos stormed the cafe in Martin Place early on Tuesday morning, ending the 16-hour siege. An investigation has been launched into the police operation. Police are also investigating the motives of Monis an Iranian refugee who faced multiple criminal charges and how he got a gun. At a press conference, Mr Abbott said: \"How can someone who has had such a long and chequered history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully.\" Image copyright EPA Rex Features Image caption Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson left and cafe manager Tori Johnson were killed in the siege However, he added that it was \"possible\" that the siege would have taken place even if Monis had been on a watch list. \"The level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very, very high indeed,\" he said. The victims have been named as cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34 and Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson, 38. In Martin Place, people have been arriving to sign condolence books and leave flowers in their memory. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment police stormed the cafe Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC Security Correspondent From Woolwich to Ottawa and now to Sydney, there is a growing list of individuals carrying out attacks in the name of global jihadism yet apparently unconnected to any organisation or co-ordinated plot. Rarely are the perpetrators unknown to the authorities. Monis was a known extremist facing criminal charges. Michael Adebolajo, one of the two Woolwich murderers in 2013, was also a known extremist who had been imprisoned in Kenya. So why were these men allowed to wander around cities, free to pick up knives or guns? The answer comes down to priorities. In open democracies, police and intelligence services do not have the manpower and resources to follow every suspect on their lists around the clock. Inevitably they have to prioritise from an ever-changing list. A radicalising event such as civilians being killed in a drone strike somewhere in the world can draw more people towards a course of violent action. Often that person may keep their thoughts to themselves and not communicate them in ways that can be tracked. In an age of so-called \"lone wolf\" attacks, prioritising suspects is an area the authorities in many countries are going to need to get better at. Four other people, including a police officer, were injured. The officer has been discharged, while the other three were in a stable condition, police said. Central Sydney was put in lockdown on Monday morning as the gunman entered the Lindt Chocolat Cafe and seized 17 hostages. Five hostages managed to sprint to safety on Monday afternoon. Several more escaped early on Tuesday, as commandos stormed the cafe. How the 16-hour Sydney siege unfolded 1.

They later report the deaths of three people, including the gunman. At a news conference on Tuesday, NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn would not say whether Monis had shot the two hostages himself. Nor would she confirm reports that Mr Johnson was shot when he grappled with Monis. But she said all the hostages had \"acted courageously\". Asked why police stormed the cafe, Commissioner Burn would say only that \"shots were heard and an emergency action plan was activated\". She said it was \"extremely important\" she did not comment on events in detail while the investigation is under way.

Police have promised more officers on the street for the next three weeks. At the scene: Wendy Frew, BBC News Online, Australia editor At Christmas time in Sydney, people come to Martin Place to see the giant Christmas tree. This year they have come to see a sea of flowers laid in memory of the victims of this week's cafe shooting. Hundreds of bouquets have been laid on the pedestrian plaza a block away from where the siege took place. Well-wishers like Maureen Sharma and Ruza Fisher have come to sign a condolence book and to lay flowers. The two young office employees who work nearby wanted to pay their respects. \"I came to work this morning and could not stop crying,\" said Ms Sharma. \"It touched me more than I had expected.\" Ms Fisher said her stomach was in knots. \"I am starting to well up. It was such a waste of lives.\" 'Unstable' Monis, a self-styled Muslim cleric, sought asylum in Australia in 1996. He had a history of religiously inspired activism, but officials say there is as yet no evidence his actions were linked to international Islamist movements. He was convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers in 2009. In 2013, he was charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, and given bail. He also faced more than 40 sexual and indecent assault charges. Image copyright EPA Image caption Monis, well known to the Australian police, was facing a raft of criminal charges Monis had \"vehemently denied\" the assault and accessory to murder charges, his former lawyer told the BBC. He \"believed he was being victimised\" for his \"lobbying against the government\", and had alleged that he was tortured while in custody, Manny Conditsis said. According to Australian media, a High Court had dismissed Monis' appeal against his previous convictions on Friday. Image copyright AP Image caption The 16-hour siege saw a major police presence deployed in the heart of Sydney A church service was held at Sydney's St Mary Cathedral on Tuesday to mourn the victims. Archbishop Anthony Fisher said the \"heart of our city is broken by the deaths of two innocents\", and urged Australians not to be caught up in \"violence and its cycle of recrimination\". The Australian National Imams Council issued a statement saying it was \"deeply saddened by the tragic end to the siege with the loss of life. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those killed and to the hostages who suffered the trauma of the siege.\"",
    "reference_summary": "As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group.",

Instead, it was a \"spiritual healer\" who sent \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was found guilty of offences related to this, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. \"This was a one-off random individual,\" says a lawyer who represented Monis at one point. \"It was not a concerted terrorism event or act. It was a damaged-goods individual who did something outrageous.\" Monis, a self-styled Muslim cleric who sought asylum in Australia in 1996, was charged with assault and sexual assault in 2013. He was also charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, a mother of two who was allegedly stabbed and set alight in April 2013. In August last year, Monis pleaded guilty to using a postal service to send the \"offensive and deplorable\" letters, which he claimed were his own version of a \"flower basket\" or \"condolence card.\" He was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and placed on a good behavior bond, but he lost his bid to have the case heard in the high court.",

After the second MPs' ballot, Home Secretary Mrs May finished with 199 votes, Energy Minister Mrs Leadsom 84 and Mr Gove, the justice secretary, 46. Conservative members will now decide the winning candidate, with the result due on 9 September. The winner will become the UK's second female prime minister. Mr Cameron resigned after finishing on the losing side in the UK's EU referendum, in which there was a vote for the UK to leave. The results were announced at Westminster by Conservative MP Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee.

Speaking after the results were announced, Mrs May said she had secured support from all wings of the Conservative Party and pledged to bring the Tories together. She promised \"strong, proven leadership\" to negotiate the UK's departure from the EU, and to \"make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us\". Conservative MP Tim Loughton, Mrs Leadsom's campaign manager, said she would bring a \"huge and fresh skills base\" to Downing Street if elected. He played down her lack of cabinet experience, saying she would have \"no problem stepping up to the job\" having had a long career outside politics, adding: \"She has done things outside of this place on so many different levels.\" Analysis by Nick Robinson, Radio 4's Today presenter Now we know. The name of Britain's next prime minister will be either Andrea or Theresa. Two women. Two Tories. Two potential leaders who whether they like it or not, whether the country likes it or not are destined to be dubbed the new Maggie. That though is where the similarities between May and Leadsom end. One of course made the case, ever so quietly, for Remain. The other argued, ever so passionately, for Leave. One is highly experienced the longest-serving home secretary for more than a century. The other would be the least experienced prime minister this country has had since Pitt the Younger. Not only has Andrea Leadsom had no Cabinet experience. Unlike David Cameron or Tony Blair, she has not served an apprenticeship as leader of the opposition. But this run-off is about much more than that. May and Leadsom are figureheads for two very different visions of Conservatism, backed by different factions which have been at war in the party for a quarter of a century. Read Nick's full article Mr Gove said he was \"naturally disappointed\" not to have made it to the final two, describing the remaining contenders as \"formidable politicians\". He welcomed the fact that the UK would be getting a second female prime minister after Margaret Thatcher and called for a \"civilised, inclusive, positive and optimistic debate\". Mr Gove did not announce backing for either candidate, but several of his key backers, including Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, switched their support to Mrs May.

Here is what you need to know about Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May. Nicki DeMarco The Washington Post For the first time since Margaret Thatcher stepped down in 1990, the next British prime minister will be a woman. Here is what you need to know about Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May. Nicki DeMarco The Washington Post The race to be Britain's next prime minister was whittled to two on Thursday, with Conservative Party lawmakers ensuring that the country will have a female head of government the nation's first since Margaret Thatcher stepped down more than a quarter-century ago. The contest will pit the home affairs secretary, Theresa May, against Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom in a race that features contenders who were on opposite sides of last month's European Union referendum. In a vote among 330 Tory members of Parliament, May was on top, with 199 votes, compared with 84 for Leadsom. A third candidate, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, was knocked out after securing 46 votes. Meet Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom, the two women vying to be Britain's next prime minister Gove had upended British politics last week by jumping into the race for prime minister at the last possible moment. The move forced the favorite, former London mayor Boris Johnson, from the contest even before he had entered. But Gove's unexpected betrayal also angered many Conservative lawmakers and prompted them to search for an alternative candidate to stand against the new front-runner, May. Speaking at the annual Conservative Party conference on Tuesday, Home Secretary Theresa May said Britain would not accept a European Union-wide immigration and asylum policy \"in a thousand years.\" YouTube Conservatives That turned out to be Leadsom, a relative unknown in British politics who serves as a junior minister but has never been a member of the cabinet normally a prerequisite for holding the nation's top job. Leadsom begins the contest as a decided underdog against the better-known May, who dominated Thursday's vote and an earlier round of balloting held Tuesday. Leadsom backers stage Britain's most awkward political rally But May will need to persuade the party's rank and file, who will take the summer to choose a winner. She wasted no time Thursday making her case, which has focused on the notion that she is the only one who can bring together the party's warring \"remain\" and \"leave\" factions. Leadsom draws her support principally from the leave camp. \"We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal for leaving the European Union, to unite our party and our country,\" May said just moments after the vote. The winner will be announced Sept. 9 and will replace David Cameron. He announced his plans to step down late last month, just a day after he was unable to persuade the country to back the remain campaign in a referendum on Britain's E.YOU. membership. YOU.K. Conservative Party leadership hopeful Andrea Leadsom told an audience in London July 7 that \"no one needs to fear our decision to leave the E.YOU.\" Leadsom is one of two candidates still in the running to be Britain's next prime minister. AP Either Leadsom or May will be Britain's first female prime minister since Thatcher, who led the country from 1979 to 1990, and the second in British history. With Hillary Clinton topping presidential polls in the United States and Chancellor Angela Merkel continuing to govern Germany, three of the West's leading countries could all be governed by women by January a historic first. And in Scotland, a woman First Minister Nicola Sturgeon could become a chief antagonist for the new British prime minister. Scotland favored remaining in the European Union, and Sturgeon could lead Scottish efforts to seek another independence bid from the United Kingdom to stay in the E.YOU. fold. It is just one front in the tricky post-referendum aftermath facing May or Leadsom. Both candidates have vowed to follow through with a British exit from the European Union popularly known as Brexit by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the never-before-used mechanism by which countries can leave the 28-member bloc. A quick Brexit or a delayed departure? But they disagree about when to move. May has suggested that it will not happen this year. Leadsom has said she will act as quickly as possible, as European leaders have demanded. \"We need to get on with it,\" she recently told the BBC. Leadsom and May were on opposite sides of the E.YOU. debate. Leadsom, a former bank executive, emerged from relative obscurity by taking a leading role in the leave campaign. May officially backed remain, but in practice she largely sat on the sidelines. She has long held strongly Euroskeptic views and has said there will be no rerun of the referendum if she becomes prime minister. \"Brexit means Brexit,\" she said last week when she announced her candidacy. Seeking to assuage any doubts among leave backers, she has at times even taken a harder line than her pro-Brexit rivals. This week, for instance, she refused to guarantee that E.YOU. citizens living in Britain will be allowed to stay once the country has left the bloc, saying the matter is up for negotiation. Other contenders, including Leadsom, took a more conciliatory line, saying that no one would be kicked out of the country because of Brexit. Despite May's maneuvering, Leadsom has sought to raise questions about the home secretary's dedication to the Brexit because. Leadsom has argued that the country can trust only a true leave champion to drive the hard bargain with Brussels on cutting ties. May, who has been responsible for the country's internal security as home secretary since 2010, has suggested that Leadsom lacks the experience necessary for the country's top job. May has pointed to her own record of negotiating tough security deals with her E.YOU. counterparts as evidence that she is uniquely prepared for the task ahead. Both Leadsom and May are to the political right of Cameron. May has taken a hard line on immigration, saying in a speech last year that mass arrivals threatened the country's \"cohesion.\" Leadsom, meanwhile, opposed the country's legalization of same-sex marriage a move that Cameron championed. Of the two, Leadsom is considered more ideological, while May is seen as relatively pragmatic. Now that Conservative members of Parliament have picked the two finalists, it will be up to the party's 150,000 rank-and-file members to select the leader to govern this nation of 65 million. Because the Conservatives won an absolute majority in Parliament in last year's general election, they do not need to go back to the public to seek a mandate for a new prime minister. Instead, party members will vote by mail through the summer. Immigrants feel caught in the middle after Britain's E.YOU. snub Polls show that May is well ahead of Leadsom among Conservative members, just as she was among the party's parliamentary delegation. The vote will come as the Brexit aftershocks continue to reverberate, with markets reeling and the pound down to its lowest level in three decades. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the investment giant Allianz, told Reuters on Thursday that the currency still has a long way to fall and could reach parity with the dollar if British politicians do not move quickly to restore stability. Leadsom said Thursday that the pound's plummet is not necessarily a because for concern, noting that it will help British exporters. In a speech in central London, Leadsom said she wants to \"banish the pessimists\" and \"spread prosperity to every corner of our country.\" The speech was billed as a major economic policy address, but she gave few details of her plans. Leadsom stayed in the hunt for the prime minister's post despite a flurry of scrutiny over apparent exaggerations on her rsum, which suggested that she had spent years working as a fund manager for a major investment firm. Leadsom acknowledged Thursday that she had not managed funds, but she insisted that she had held a senior management job at Invesco Perpetual. Johnson, who backed Leadsom in a move widely perceived as revenge against Gove, issued a statement Wednesday calling her \"well placed to win and replace the absurd gloom in some quarters with a positive, confident and optimistic approach.\" He also celebrated the fact that the Tories will have been responsible for both of Britain's female prime ministers, calling the center-right party \"the most progressive party in Britain.\" Karla Adam in London and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.

    "document": "Why Has This Man Been Honked at Over 5,000 Times? By ANDREW PAPARELLA, ERIC M. STRAUSS and ALEXA VALIENTE Here is the Situation: Long-time Hubbard, Ohio, residents Rick and Cindy Krlich told ABC News' \"20 20? that everyone in their town has turned against them. Over the past seven years, they said, horns have been honked 5,000 times by people driving past their house. \"In the beginning, it was 100 times a day,\" Rick Krlich said. Lately, the couple said, it has settled down to once or twice a day. What Started It All: In a 2007 real estate deal, Rick Krlich got into a dispute with John Clemente over the house next door. It is a long complicated story, but essentially, Rick Krlich sued in an attempt to buy the house when it was in probate court, even though it had been in the Clemente family for several generations. Rick Krlich succeeded only in annoying John Clemente, who at the time was the town fire chief. His lawsuit failed, and the Clementes moved into the house. Rick Krlich's Side of the Story: According to Rick Krlich, John Clemente and his family retaliated by organizing a vast conspiracy of horn honking that has continued throughout the years since. The Krlich home now has surveillance cameras to record when and who honks their horns while driving past the house. From a fireman in a fire engine to a police officer from a nearby town, the Krlich's have recorded many honkers throughout the years. Rick is now suing no fewer than 40 alleged horn blowers, including the Clementes. John Clemente's Side of the Story: John and Marlene Clemente deny they instigated the honking. According to John Clemente, his son's girlfriend and some of her friends would blow the horn, but he said that was just their way of saying goodbye. And while a fire truck and other Hubbard residents have been caught on video honking the horn outside of the Krlich house, John Clemente said that Rick Krlich brought it on himself. \"Why would not you be against him and what he is doing to everybody?\" John Clemente told \"20 20.\" \"Do you realize he has got 700 cases going to court?\" \"If you beep your horn one time, he will take you to court,\" Marlene Clemente told \"20 20.\" \"Just a regular beep or just to beep at the neighbors across the street, he will take you to court.\" A Solution? In an attempt to bring together a town blown apart by a destructive horn-honking habit, \"20 20? invited the Clementes, the Krlich's and the town of Hubbard to a Peace and Reconciliation Barbecue.

Despite proof of the harassment, police have refused to investigate his complaints or punish anyone for the honking, according to a complaint filed Thursday by Garrick Krlich in Youngstown federal court. Krlich claims Hubbard, Ohio Police Chief James R. Taafe, the city of Hubbard and Trumball County \"intentionally 'turned a blind eye' to the rights and plight of plaintiff and his wife, but numerous city and county officials, executives and employees have been recorded actively, directly and intentionally participating in this campaign, sometimes while in city and or county vehicles.\" Krich contends the harassment began in 2007, when he tried to purchase a property adjacent to his own. The property was up for auction following the death of the then-fire chief's aunt. After Krlich placed the highest bid, former Fire Chief John Clemente Jr. allegedly \"told plaintiff to rescind his bid or they would be 'bitter enemies for life,' because the house had been in his family since 1922.\" Although Krlich refused to rescind his winning bid, \"title to the property did not pass to him as it should have,\" according to the complaint, and he was harassed anyway. \"Members of the Clemente family and their friends and coworkers including many of John Clemente Jr.'s coworkers in the Hubbard Fire Department began a campaign to harass, intimidate and terrorize plaintiff and his wife by honking their horns whenever they drove past plaintiff's residence, which continues to this day,\" the lawsuit states. Parentheses in original. In the complaint, Krlich claims he has called the police and 911 about the honking, and has gone so far as obtaining civil protection orders against some of the harassers, but nothing has been done. He says he installed video and audio recording equipment to capture \"countless incidents of horn blowing by passing motorists, including, inter alia, the Hubbard Police Chief's son and brother, City of Hubbard councilmen, members of Hubbard Police Department while driving police cruisers City of Hubbard firemen while driving City fire trucks as well as numerous city and county officials, school buses and others connected to the local governments. Parentheses in original. Despite this proof, the police department has failed and refused to do anything, Krlich alleges. He claims the police department refuses to take many of his reports, and 911 has hung up on him. \"The Hubbard Police Department and Trumball 9-1-1 Center require plaintiff, and only plaintiff, to follow a specific 'protocol' prior to contacting the Hubbard Police Department or 9-1-1 Center, or they will not respond to, or accept, a noise or harassment complaint from him,\" the lawsuit states. A city attorney for Hubbard did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment. Krlich is suing Hubbard, Police Chief Taafe and Trumball County for an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He is seeking compensatory damages for his video recording equipment and legal fees as well as punitive damages, in a total amount exceeding 75,000. He is represented by Caryn Groedel in Cleveland.

Krlich says when he put in the highest offer, then-Fire Chief John Clemente Jr. told him he would better take it back or risk being \"bitter enemies.\" Krlich kept his bid in, though for unspecified reasons, the property \"did not pass to him as it should have\"-and, he says, the harassment started anyway.

In a 2014 20 20 interview, Krlich says the honking peaked at 100 times a day it is since died down to just a couple per day Clemente and his wife noted in the same interview that Krlich was simply litigious. \"If you beep your horn one time, he will take you to court,\" Marlene Clemente said.",

    "document": "When it comes to air travel in the YOU.S., there are two realities. Most of us the 930 million passengers who flew out of a YOU.S. airport last year think flying has never been worse. Seats keep getting smaller and closer together; seat cushions are getting thinner. Everything costs extra: bags, food, and even things we took to be basics, like seat assignments and carry-ons. Flights are something you endure with your knees pressed against the seat in front of you, feet jammed next to your backpack or purse, hoping you do not get dragged off the plane against your will. \"None of us fly by choice,\" one disgruntled United passenger recently wrote in a pretty representative tweet. \"Flying sucks, period.\" But there is another group of people who see it differently: industry experts. These people say flying has never been better. It is the cheapest it is ever been, affordable for the majority of Americans. It is safer. Your bags are less likely to get lost. On-time arrivals are hovering around 80 percent in recent years, the best it is ever been. You are likely to have honest-to-god internet on a damn plane. So this is a conundrum. How can flying be both the best and the worst it is ever been? We have to get one thing out of the way. The experts are right. Flying is, objectively speaking, the best it is ever been. Saying that flying is the best it is ever been, of course, requires knowing what it used to be. In the 1960s, if you or your company could afford to fly you somewhere, you would first have to go to a travel agent or airline ticket desk. You would buy your flight and try your best not to lose your ticket. On the day of the flight, ticket in hand, you would get to the airport 20 minutes in advance, go through a metal detector, settle into one of your seats on an almost-never-full plane and get served a TV dinner-esque meal while sitting in seats more or less akin to today's Amtrak arrangement. You could smoke in the last 10 or so rows, but since you are in a giant metal tube, the entire plane reeked of cigarette smoke. At some point, we were socialized to hate flying. Until 1978, the federal government regulated which airlines could fly which routes and how much they could charge. Since airlines could not compete on price, so they had to differentiate themselves in other ways: legroom, meals, service, blankets, and so on. Which is to say, airlines competed by making flying as comfortable as possible. Prices were fixed not to keep flying affordable, but to keep airlines profitable. In 1974, it was literally illegal for an airline to charge less than 305, which would be 1,607 in 2017 dollars after adjusting for inflation, for a cross-country flight between New York and Los Angeles. Obviously, this meant far fewer Americans could afford it. In 1965, only 20 percent of Americans had ever flown on an airplane, and the portion that could afford it was overwhelmingly likely to be white. As part of a surge of deregulation across the federal government, airlines were suddenly free to start competing in another way: by offering lower prices. At this point, basic supply and demand principles kicked in. Fares could be cheaper if they put more people on each plane. Meals are expensive to offer 30,000 feet in the air one of my favorite airline cost-cutting stories: Northwest reportedly saved 500,000 a year by slicing its limes 16 ways as opposed to Delta's 10 And, in the past 15 years in particular, major airlines merged to fend off bankruptcy and unbundled their products remember when you could book a seat in the exit row which has more leg room for free? and charged fees for everything. But, even with the fees, flying is still cheaper and more accessible to the general public than it has ever been. That New York to Los Angeles flight that cost 1,607? The average fare, including first class and premium economy tickets, is now is around 700. But you can almost certainly find a flight in economy for less than 500, maybe even under 300 if you catch a sale just yesterday Alaska Airlines ran a sale for 206 round trip And it is not only that one route. Overall, domestic airfares have fallen by approximately 50 percent after adjusting for inflation since deregulation in 1978. If you do want extra leg room, a meal, a checked bag, or a wider seat? That is still there, in the form of premium economy or even first class. Looking at a random one week period in February, you can fly round-trip from New York to LA for 277, or upgrade to premium economy for 543. You could even splurge and fly JetBlue's fantastic Mint first class for 1,117, or 500 cheaper than the legally mandated price in 1978. Which is to say: even if you purchased every perk or add-on for your New York to L.A. flight, it is still cheaper and better than it was before. With the masses being able to afford to fly, anxiety about flying was more common than straight complaining. Crashes, bad turbulence, and even hijacking used to be a common fear, which was buttressed by humor. The flying experience became a frequent target for stand-up comedians and other humorists to defuse the tension. The Friar's Club Encyclopedia of Jokes has a section on flying one-liners featuring Bob Hope, Shelley Berman, Garry Shandling, and Howie Mandel. \"I am giving up flying,\" a joke by Corbett Monica went. \"I was at the airport and I saw a sign: 'Take Out Insurance.' I thought, if the lobby's that dangerous, imagine what it is like in the plane.\" Many of the jokes obviously predate 9 11 \"Ever been frisked on a plane trip? They frisk you and then, on the plane, everybody has a steak knife!\" joked Shelley Berman and tend to deal more with safety concerns instead of lack of comfort or inconvenience. Professor David McNeil, who studies comedy and satire at Dalhousie University, told me that although he does not have a precise history of flying jokes, he thinks it adheres to an old Freudian theory about dealing with anxiety through humor: \"We joke about flying because it scares us to death.\" After safety concerns became less prominent, comedians transitioned to joking about airline quality. In 1992, Saturday Night Live performed a skit with Jerry Seinfeld, Rob Schneider, Dana Carvey, and Adam Sandler called Stand-Up And Win, a mock Jeopardy! designed to poke fun at Seinfeldian prompts. The first question: \"What is the deal with airplane food?\" The \"correct\" answer from Schneider: \"I know, could this stuff taste any worse? It is like thanks but no thanks, I am still stuffed from that huge bag of smoked almonds.\" \"Airplanes\" was also the first category on the board along with \"cereals,\" \"commercials\", and \"7-11 employees.\" The airplane bit goes on for a bit longer: A shot from a mock Jeopardy sketch from SNL in 1992 that poked fun at jokes about airlines. Incidentally, this skit is also the origin of the \"Why do not they build the whole plane out of the black box?\" meta-joke. A shot from a mock Jeopardy sketch from SNL in 1992 that poked fun at jokes about airlines. It is also not just airline companies and their policies that make us complain, but the process of flying itself. George Carlin was more insightful than anyone, linking old school one-liners, quality complaints, and a profound insight into what flying does to the human psyche. It all comes together in a 1992 bit about the safety lecture. \"This is my favorite part of the airplane ride,\" Carlin sarcastically noted. \"I listen very carefully to the safety lecture, especially that part where they teach us how to use\" dramatic pause \"the seat belts! Imagine this. Here we are, a plane full of grown human beings, many of us partially educated, and they are actually taking time out to describe the intricate workings of a belt buckle.\" Unlike some of the other comedy routines, Carlin addressed a fundamental issue not with airlines specifically, but the language used during the flying process in general, an issue backed up by research. A 2007 study in the fantastically named Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction and Complaining Behavior analyzed a year's worth of comments on Untied.com, a complaint forum for United customers, to study how powerlessness affects complaints. It should not be glossed over that to study powerlessness, researchers chose an airline complaint website; powerlessness is a fundamental part of flying. We are told what to do while we are herded through security, barked at by TSA officers, told where to line up by flight attendants, instructed when to turn off our phones or fasten our seatbelts and bring the tray tables into their upright and locked position, when we can get up and go to the bathroom. Pretty much everything about the process of flying is controlled by others whose positions of authority feel vaguely arbitrary another point Carlin nails in mocking terms like \"uniformed crew members\" or \"captain\" Short of interactions with law enforcement, flying may be the most powerless you will feel in your entire adult life. Powerlessness matters because, as the study found, it is one of the key triggers of complaining. \"I had to vent because it was killing me to let someone get away with treating me like I was just one of a herd of cows,\" one representative untied.com forum comment read. Another lamented, \"I am tired of being treated like a stupid animal by a dumb telephone answer machine.\" One result of powerlessness is what the researchers termed \"heightened vigilance,\" which basically means we are stuck in a negative feedback loop and primed to complain even more. The study cites two complaints that show how this might manifest: \"The agent at the international check-in was rude and I feel misrouted my luggage intentionally.\" The complaint went beyond \"my luggage got lost\" to encompass the agent's attitude and add that the lost luggage was on purpose. Another comment: \"I am not being vindictive when I say, 'I think she the flight attendant had it in for me.'\" Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly, has a theory about why flying feels worse when it is actually much better. His theory is that at some point, we were socialized to hate flying. \"I had to vent because it was killing me to let someone get away with treating me like I was just one of a herd of cows.\" a commenter on untied.com, the forum for kvetching about United Airlines He said, sure, people sometimes experience discomfort or annoyances, but that is not the main reason they hate flying. Rather, people simply feel like they are supposed to hate flying, that they are supposed to grumble about airlines. Flying is a communal experience. We wait together, take our shoes off at security together, wait together, stuff ourselves into a metal tube together, get off as quickly as possible together, and then laugh at the jokes about how horrible it all was together. \"Complaints are rarely voiced in a vacuum,\" Dr. Robin Kowalski of Clemson University wrote in a 1996 paper. Complaining is an icebreaker, she told me recently, as well as a way to one-up each other. \"I definitely think there is a social element to complaining,\" she said. It did not take long for complaining about airplane food to become complaining about airlines in general. The bad food became the absence of bad food became TSA became less leg room became baggage fees became Dr. Dao getting dragged off the plane. And now there is Twitter, where humor is completely bypassed. According to a Twitter marketing report, people send an average of 100,000 questions, complaints, and comments to YOU.S. airlines every month. Everyone has an airline horror story. I once endured a cross-country flight in a middle seat, crammed between a bodybuilder and a gentleman of generous proportions, leaving me access to roughly 60 percent of my seat width and zero armrests. Those unpleasant experiences are not negated by affordability. The fact that air travel used to be expensive journeys in smoke-filled dens does not make me feel any better about having my luggage lost or being trapped on the runway. But one reason there are more of those stories than ever is because more people are flying than ever. In 2016, US airlines carried 34 percent more passengers than it did in 2002. That is an increase of 209 million passengers. To put that in perspective, in 1974, the US airline industry had 207 million passengers total. Part of what makes flying so miserable, as alluded to in some of the untied.com comments, is the scale. The more people fly, the more the industry has to scale their product and the more dehumanizing it becomes. A necessary condition of feeling like a herd of cows is the presence of a herd. Most people understand we cannot have a first class experience on economy fares, but pine for a happy medium where we are given a seat commensurate with our dignity, treated humanely by airline staff, and generally arrive on-time barring mitigating circumstances, all for a reasonable price. That sounds nice, right? Part of what makes flying so miserable is the scale. A necessary condition of feeling like a herd of cows is the presence of a herd. Well, on the vast majority of the almost billion trips we take every year, I think we already have that. It is just that we love to complain about the ones where we do not. Kowalski made another point in her paper. It is a bit indirect, but I think it matters here. The more we focus on how we are feeling, or our \"internal state,\" the more likely we are to complain. And boredom, it turns out, has consistently been found to increase our focus on our internal state. If nothing else, surely we can agree on this: Flying is so boring. Everything about flying is waiting for the next thing: to get in line to board, to board, to close the door, to taxi, to take off, to land, to taxi, to open the door, to get off the plane. Flying is governed by what is next, which means we are always waiting. You could give me an in-flight entertainment system loaded with the entire library of human artistic achievement and I would still somehow be bored because I am on an airplane, waiting. Then I think about the fact I am waiting. And now I am noticing my butt's sore. And the guy in front of me reclined his seat. And I still have three more hours to go.

But sharing some of these things, while perhaps controversial, could be to their, your, and other passengers' benefit, if only someone would say something.

The Outline's full story works to bust some misconceptions, and Business Insider does something similar. It talks to 80 airline workers-the ones who staff the gates, the planes, the customer service lines-to share the secrets they wish they could share. Here are 5 standouts: Know I am not being rude when I do not give you a free upgrade: One customer service agent explains \"the airline computer system tracks everything, and big brother can be watching us\"-and doling out a free upgrade improperly can be a fireable offense. Do not take off your shoes: It might be tempting to wiggle those toes under the seat, but this is not your house, and that \"water\" you are stepping on in the bathroom is not actually water. Do not let those hands wander: If you are tempted to tug at your flight attendant's clothes to get his or her attention as they walk by, just do not. Ever. Keep the number 50 in mind: That is how many passengers are generally served by a single flight attendant. We are not forgetting about you, explains one. We are just dealing with minimal staffing. Know I have to do what the FAA says: That includes saying specific things. Not following the FAA's rules and regulations could cause a flight attendant to be fined.

LaVergne also said that the hotel-casino had apparently decided before Simpson's visit to trespass him from the property. LaVergne says that after Simpson was notified, he left the hotel-casino quietly. In addition, Simpson is challenging anyone with proof that he was drunk and belligerent to come forward.

    "document": "TORONTO AP The new premier of Ontario is the brother of late Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who became famous for smoking crack cocaine. Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have won the provincial election in Canada's most populous province. Doug Ford is a populist who has been compared to YOU.S. President Donald Trump. Rob's Ford's tenure as mayor of the country's largest city was marred by revelations about his illegal drug use. Rob Ford died of cancer in 2016. A Liberal defeat Thursday was predicted by outgoing Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne herself just days before the vote. The party had been in power for 15 years. Doug Ford's election promises include income tax cuts and he strongly opposes a carbon tax. <doc_sep> He may be polarizing to a significant segment of voters, have run a messy campaign and come with his own political baggage, but Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford may just have been the \"ideal candidate\" to win this Ontario election. This assessment comes not from a conservative political partisan, but from Don Guy, veteran Liberal political campaign strategist, former campaign director and former chief of staff to Liberal ex-premier Dalton McGuinty. \"I think he was the ideal candidate because he gave small-c conservative voters a very comfortable home, a very comfortable archetype and a very strong message,\" he said. Certainly Ford benefited significantly from a voting public looking for change tired of the Liberals and their unpopular leader Kathleen Wynne, who was never able to completely distance herself from the scandal-plagued McGuinty years or convince voters she represented a clean start for the party. Ford, as well, was able to capitalize on Ontario voters who may have had no love for him, but remained somewhat skeptical of the NDP. But Ford's majority win was also a vindication for his team against the naysayers, including some in his own party, who believed his rise to the leadership doomed their chances. In the end, his controversial years by the side of his brother Rob Ford during his reign as mayor, scandals over party nominations, last-minute headlines about legal disputes with his brother's widow none of it had enough impact to curb his path to victory. 'He came across as sensible' \"I think the fact that he came across as sensible during the debates really helped him a lot,\" said Kathy Brock, a political scientist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. \"He did not get upset during them. It was a very controlled campaign. He was very much in control as well. WATCH: Doug Ford greets supporters in victory PC Leader Doug Ford addresses crowd at his headquarters in Etobicoke on election night. 0:46 \"He had his key messages. He stayed on point. He repeated them.\" Ford's control, says Brock, also served to counter the image his opponents tried to create, that he was a radical, hard-right conservative and Donald Trump clone. None of Trump's xenophobia While there may be similarities with Trump in terms of populist appeal, Ford, like his brother, had made significant inroads into various ethnic communities in Toronto, and his campaign has none of the xenophobia attached to the YOU.S. president's, said Brock. And like his brother, Doug Ford portrayed himself as a tax-cutting warrior, a fiscal conservative who believes governments waste too much taxpayers' money. That message, says Guy, was simple and repeated over and over a Ford government will be a responsible steward for taxpayers' money, \"and that help is on the way for hard-working families.\" Ford said he would cut taxes, cut the price of gas, cut hydro rates, cut the price of beer and eliminate the deficit while spending billions on transit and infrastructure projects. Supporters react in Toronto on Thursday night after learning Doug Ford had won a majority government. Mark Blinch Canadian Press \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" said Ryerson University political science professor Myer Siemiatycki. \"So you know those are tangible deliverables that one could imagine people are attracted to.\" WATCH: The leaders and the Ontario election results: This is the 2018 Ontario election in 90 seconds. 1:27 How Ford would deliver on these pledges was never fully explained. It was not until the end of May that his campaign put out a costed platform, with the exception of an important detail. While putting a price tag on those and other promises, they neglected to include how any of them would be paid for. Finding 'efficiencies' Yet Ford's go-to explanation, simply that he would find \"efficiencies\" in government, may have resonated with voters. \"People do see government as being wasteful in some ways. Everybody's got a story about that. So that kind of hits home,\" said Brock. Premier Kathleen Wynne tells supporters Thursday night that she is resigning as Liberal leader. Christopher Katsarov Canadian Press Ford's strategists employed a front-runners campaign, minimizing the opportunities for him to make mistakes, which included little access for the media. Indeed, the imprecision of the policy platform was designed to keep the different coalitions within that party together and the different voting coalitions together without getting pinned down on anything that is too specific, said Cristine de Clercy, a political science professor at Western University in London, Ont. Imprecision does not hurt \"Clearly that that did not substantially hurt them, it was a viable decision,\" said de Clercy. \"If you think you are going to win, why basically give your opponents the opportunity to attack your plan?\" Ford's campaign, put together relatively last minute following the sudden departure of former leader Patrick Brown, was by normal standards, disorganized and slow, not at all what one would expect from the party, said Jonathan Malloy, chair of the political science department at Carleton University. On the campaign trail, Ford got out to greet supporters, including these ones in Ottawa. Justin Tang Canadian Press \"And you know that sort of chaos is consistent with the leader's brand. I mean, Mr. Ford does not pretend to be a smooth organized individual, and the campaign platform reflected that.\" Chaotic, maybe, but ultimately simple and effective, said Guy. 'The magic of it' \"That was the magic of it. The simplicity of the message, simplicity of the strategy, everybody could understand it.\" The winning strategy, Guy says, was simply to take the angry rural conservative base that is been building over the last four elections and add the established voting pool made up of Ford Nation, that core group of supporters in Toronto who were faithful to former mayor Rob Ford and were the key to his one-term rule. Some believed Christine Elliott may have been a stronger, safer candidate who appealed to other voters and demographics not enamoured of Ford. But Guy said the strategy the party implemented would not have been readily available to her, meaning no one can say whether Elliott would have made an even better showing. \"They would have had to invent a whole new wheel.\" Despite Ford's victory, Siemiatycki noted the strong showing of the NDP and the seats won in different pockets of Ontario. \"This was not a Ford landslide romp to victory,\" he said. \"Among all the Ontarians who voted in this election, the majority did not support Mr. Ford. So it is not like there is this massive groundswell of attachment to Mr. Ford.\" <doc_sep> The province of Ontario is now a Ford nation. Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford capped an improbable rise to power Thursday, winning the Ontario election with a majority government and banishing Kathleen Wynne's Liberals into political oblivion after almost 15 years in office. Doug Ford's Ontario Progressive Conservatives will form a majority government following Thursday's provincial election. The premier-elect says he will continue the legacy of his late brother Rob, a former Toronto mayor. The Canadian Press \"This is incredible. My friends, this victory belongs to you. Tonight the people of Ontario have spoken. You have come together around one common vision of Ontario,\" Ford, 53, told cheering supporters in Etobicoke. \"We will work every single day for a better Ontario,\" said the rookie leader, who only took the helm on March 10 after the resignation of Patrick Brown. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath will be the leader of the official opposition in a radically changed legislature that will feature dozens of new Tory, New Democratic, and Green MPPs. Article Continued Below \"From the very start of this campaign, people wanted change and I could not be more proud that we offered a positive vision. Change for the better,\" Horwath, 55, told loyalists in Hamilton. Wynne's party, in power since her predecessor Dalton McGuinty defeated the Tories in 2003, was reduced to a tiny rump, falling short of the eight seats required for official status in the legislature. Ontario's first female premier, who succeeded McGuinty in February 2013, took the unusual step of conceding defeat last Saturday in a desperate attempt to salvage Liberal seats. \"This is a difficult night,\" said Wynne, 65, who is stepping down as Liberal leader. Ontario PC leader Doug Ford reacts after winning the Ontario Provincial election to become the new premier in Toronto, on Thursday, June 7, 2018 CARLOS OSORIO TORONTO STAR \"There is another generation and I am passing the torch to that generation,\" she said. Still, there are few to grasp it numerous members of Wynne's cabinet were defeated, including Finance Minister Charles Sousa. Surviving ministers Michael Coteau, Marie-France Lalonde, and Nathalie Des Rosiers are mentioned as potential future leaders. Article Continued Below One prominent Liberal casualty was Jim Bradley, St. Catharines MPP since 1977. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, who turns 49 on Saturday, made history, though, becoming his party's first MPP by winning in Guelph. \"I am ready to take my seat at Queen's Park,\" said Schreiner. In some ways, Ford is an accidental premier. Until Brown's departure, he planned on a rematch this October against Toronto Mayor John Tory, who beat him municipally in 2014. But the most eventful provincial campaign in decades was upended January 24 when CTV News aired a report alleging sexual impropriety against Brown involving two women. While he denied the allegations and is now suing CTV, which stands by its story, for 8 million he was forced to resign early on January 25. That triggered an expedited Tory leadership race that Christine Elliott, who had finished second to Brown in 2015 and third in the 2009 contest, was expected to win. Even though Elliott received the most votes and won more ridings at the party's chaotic March 10 convention, Ford narrowly edged her in the party's convoluted \"points\" tally. It was a stunning rebuke of the party elites by an outsider that Brown's Tories had not even wanted as a local candidate.

Opinion Ontario has given Doug Ford carte blanche to do virtually anything he wants Dynasties come and go in Canadian politics Ontario PC leader Doug Ford wins a majority government. His staunch supporters praise him as a political outsider sure to shake things up at Queen's Park. The Canadian Press They felt his reputation at Toronto city hall, where he was a key figure in the tumultuous mayoralty of his controversial late brother, Rob Ford, would undermine the modern, inclusive party they were building. At the PC policy convention last November, the one-term Toronto councillor was a solitary figure hovering alone at the back of the hall during the then leader's speech. But since taking the reins, he has brought Elliott into the fold along with another former leadership rival, Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Both women will sit at Ford's cabinet table. Also expected to be ministers are the newly elected Rod Phillips and Peter Bethlenfalvy and MPPs Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, Steve Clark, and John Yakabuski. Having what was seen as a deep potential ministerial bench was critical to Ford's success. After Horwath narrowed the gap in public opinion polls following his shaky performance in the three leaders' debates last month, he scrambled to showcase his team, which he maintained was \"ready to govern\" in contrast to the NDP. Many New Democratic candidates, he insisted, were \"radical downtown Toronto elites,\" who should not be given the keys to Queen's Park. However, voters may have handed Ford a blank cheque. He has promised to cut spending by 6 billion and vowed to do it painlessly without slashing even one public-sector job. \"Not one,\" he repeatedly said without specifying where he would find such massive \"efficiencies.\" His platform, never fully costed despite promises it would be, consisted of a series of populist planks like a 10 cents a litre reduction in gasoline taxes, lowering the floor price of beer to 1, selling beer and wine in convenience stores, and reducing personal and corporate taxes. On the campaign trail, his handlers limited media exposure and the freewheeling Ford from Toronto city hall was recast as a carefully scripted politician behind a teleprompter. Still, he weathered a bevy of problems, including revelations he attended a political fundraiser in April even though that is against the new campaign finance law, that he appeared to have flouted PC rules to sell memberships for candidate Kinga Surma, and that one of his former candidates was linked to the alleged data breach at the 407 ETR that compromised the personal information of 60,000 motorists. As well, Rob Ford's widow filed a 16.5 million lawsuit Friday alleging Doug Ford and older brother, Randy Ford, had cheated her and her children out of her late husband's inheritance. Doug Ford denied Renata Ford's allegations, which have not been proven in court. Yet none of these potential landmines hurt the first victorious Tory campaign since Mike Harris was re-elected in 1999. For Wynne, defeat appeared to have been preordained with Liberal insiders pointing to 2015 as the year when the wheels began to fall off. That was the year of the Sudbury byelection debacle that saw Wynne's deputy chief of staff charged with bribery and then exonerated in 2017. It was also when the premier decided to sell the majority share in Hydro One, the provincial transmission utility, using the proceeds to bankroll transportation infrastructure. Both Ford and Horwath successfully conflated the partial privatization with rising electricity bills even though that is a separate issue. Ford has even promised to fire Mayo Schmidt, the highly paid Hydro One CEO he derided as \"the six million dollar man.\" And in 2015, Wynne injected herself into the federal election campaign, helping Justin Trudeau defeat Stephen Harper to become prime minister, but appearing in the public's eyes as just another partisan politician. \"Our poll numbers started to decline then and we never recovered,\" confided one senior Liberal, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal strategy. While Wynne returned to her social-justice roots, raising the minimum wage to 14 an hour from 11.60 and promised to make it 15 next year, a raise Ford has said he will cancel as well as introducing free prescription drug coverage for everyone under 25, it was not enough to save the Liberals.

    "reference_summary": "The Ford family scored its biggest-ever political victory Thursday night-more than two years after the death of Rob Ford. Doug Ford, older brother of the notorious former Toronto mayor, was elected premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, the AP reports. Ford, who was narrowly elected leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party in March after former leader Patrick Brown stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct, won a resounding victory over current Premier Kathleen Wynne, whose Liberal Party had been in power for 15 years. Ford-who, unlike his brother, is not known for drinking heavily or smoking crack-campaigned on a populist platform that led to comparisons to President Trump. Ford's campaign promises included cutting gasoline taxes, lowering the minimum price of beer to 1, and making marijuana more widely available after it is legalized this year, reports the Toronto Star. \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" political science professor Myer Siemiatycki tells the CBC. Days before the election, Rob Ford's widow, Renata Ford, filed a 12.6 million lawsuit against Doug Ford and Randy Ford, another Ford brother, accusing them of mismanaging the family business and cheating her and her children out of her husband's inheritance.",
    "generated_summary": "Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have won the provincial election in Canada's most populous province, the Toronto Star reports. Doug Ford is a populist who has been compared to US President Donald Trump. Rob's Ford's tenure as mayor of the country's largest city was marred by revelations about his illegal drug use. A Liberal defeat Thursday was predicted by outgoing Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne herself just days before the vote. The party had been in power for 15 years. Ford's election promises include income tax cuts and he strongly opposes a carbon tax, the AP reports. He may be polarizing to a significant segment of voters, have run a messy campaign and come with his own political baggage, but Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford may just have been the \"ideal candidate\" to win this Ontario election. This assessment comes not from a conservative political partisan, but from Don Guy, veteran Liberal political campaign strategist, former campaign director, and former chief of staff to Liberal ex-premier Dalton McGuinty. Ford, as well, was able to capitalize on Ontario voters who may have had no love for him, but remained somewhat skeptical of the NDP. But Ford's majority win was also a vindication for his team against the naysayers, including some in his own party, who believed his rise to the leadership doomed their chances. In the end, his controversial years by the side of his brother Rob Ford during his reign as mayor, scandals over party nominations, last-minute headlines about legal disputes with his brother's widow none of it had enough impact to curb his path to victory. \"I think the fact that he came across as sensible during the debates really helped him a lot,\" says Kathy Brock, a political scientist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. \"He did not get upset during them. It was a very controlled campaign. He was very much in control as well.\" \"This is incredible. My friends, this victory belongs to you. Tonight the people of Ontario have spoken. You have come together around one common vision of Ontario. We will work every single day for a better Ontario.\"",

    "document": "'Django' Actress We Got the Pictures And It Looks Like Sex 'Django Unchained' Actress We Got the Pictures And It Looks Like Sex EXCLUSIVE The actress who cried racism against the LAPD claiming they harassed and hurt her because she was just making out with her white boyfriend in a car has some explaining to do, because we obtained pictures that seem to show A LOT more than sucking face.The pictures were taken Thursday outside the CBS lot in Studio City. You seestraddling BF Brian their hands steadying themselves around the sunroof.An eyewitness who saw Daniele and Brian as he worked in a nearby office tells TMZ Brian was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Daniele was straddling him with her shirt pulled up breasts exposed. The eyewitness says she was grinding on top of him, rocking back and forth.Someone from the office went down and asked Daniele and Brian to stop because everyone in the office could see them but they continued.The eyewitnesses say Brian then began \"horizontally bongoing her boobs back and forth.\" He says she eventually reached into the center console, grabbed a tissue, wiped him down and then herself and tossed it on the grass.Someone from the office called the cops and made an indecent exposure complaint. TMZ obtained police audio when the cops came out, and Daniele played the race and fame cards. <doc_sep> Sgt. Jim Parker refutes the account of the actress, contending that he recorded the incident from the moment he got out of his car The Los Angeles police officer involved in a confrontation with Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts is emphatically defending himself against any charges of wrongdoing. \"She is lying,\" LAPD Sgt. Jim Parker tells The Hollywood Reporter, contending the actress is making \"malicious and false statements.\" Watts, who is African-American, says the police accused her of prostitution because she was being publicly affectionate with her white boyfriend, Brian James Lucas. \"Today I was handcuffed and detained by 2 police officers from the Studio City Police Department after refusing to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place,\" Watts wrote on her Facebook page on Thursday. \"When the officer arrived, I was standing on the sidewalk by a tree. I was talking to my father on my cellphone. I knew that I had done nothing wrong, that I was not harming anyone, so I walked away. A few minutes later, I was still talking to my dad when 2 different police officers accosted me and forced me into handcuffs,\" adding that her wrists were \"bleeding in pain.\" But Parker refutes Watts' account, saying he was already near the location to meet up with two other LAPD officers at Starbucks when he got a call about public nudity at the corner of Radford Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, near CBS Studios. Parker tells THR that he recorded the incident from the moment he got out of his car to when it ended. \"They were f-ing. He was in the passenger seat with his legs outside,\" Parker says, paraphrasing a call from someone at the Art Directors Guild office, complaining about employees watching a couple having sex in a car in broad daylight with the door open, complete with a description of the make and license plate of the car and description of the couple and what they were wearing. He says at least one witness took a photo. \"People do not make this shit up.\" Parker says he did not plan on arresting the couple, who he says were no longer engaged in intercourse, and standing outside the car; she was on the phone. \"People having sex in the car, no biggie. No one wants to arrest anybody,\" Parker says. \"And he Lucas said, 'Oh, I have her passport.' He was wearing two tourist bags around his neck and I assumed he had hers. She was feigning disinterest, but I could tell she was listening in. Then as you hear on the recording, she starts making a fuss, and quite frankly I do not need to see her ID but she does have to ID herself.\" The recording, which was made public by TMZ on Monday, features a woman's voice saying, \"Do you know how many times the cops have been called because I am black? Just because I am black and he is white?\" Later, she says, \"You can say I am resisting arrest,\" and put her father, who she was speaking with on her cellphone, on speaker to talk to the police, saying, \"It is my right to stand on the street corner and make out with my boyfriend.\" But cops say they were doing more than making out. \"There is no resisting; you are just interfering,\" a policeman is heard saying. LAPD sources tell THR that TMZ's recording is authentic. Parker says he knew the other officers were nearby when Watts walked away from him as the situation escalated, but he did not want to chase after her or physically confront her. \"I have been here before, I am not touching her. I do not want to be accused of anything. So I requested a female officer and said, 'Hey guys, grab that female on the phone and bring her back to me.'\" \"I am thinking, 'God, it is taking a long time to bring her back to me,' Parker continues. \"They two other officers said, 'She is being difficult.' They have her handcuffed, because that is what they do. It is too far to walk, so they drove her back. And I said, 'You have to give me your ID or tell me your name.' She is crying.\" Watts, who is also on the FX show Partners, told CNN on Monday that the LAPD \"accosted me and forced me into handcuffs,\" and repeated what she had said on the recording, that the cops alleged \"I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.\" She also told CNN she felt disrespected when police asked Lucas for her ID instead of asking her directly. \"She had no idea I was recording. So I asked her, 'Why are you in handcuffs? He is Lucas been here this whole time not in handcuffs. Tell me if someone has been disrespectful,'\" Parker says he asked the actress when she returned, handcuffed and distressed, adding that the recording exonerates the LAPD in this situation. \"Police officers can record surreptitiously without consent. The other officers also had their recording on. It helps the police department.\" The LAPD confirmed it is conducting an internal investigation because of the widespread publicity surrounding the incident. If he had not made the recording, Parker says, \"The three of us would be relieved of duty right now.\" Watts' agent did not immediately return an email for comment.

    "document": "Paul Ceglia, the 39-year-old western New York man who in 2010 sued Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg for 84 of the company, has been indicted on federal charges of wire and mail fraud for allegedly faking evidence in the case. Ceglia claimed in his original lawsuit that Zuckerberg promised him a huge stake in Facebook in return for coding work on Facebook performed in 2003. According to this week's indictment, however, Ceglia was indeed contracted to work on Facebook, but he created a falsified contract \"in which Zuckerberg agreed to provide Ceglia with at least a 50 percent interest in Facebook.\" Ceglia, who was arrested and first charged in a criminal complaint last month, is also accused of creating fake e-mails and destroying evidence in the case against him. His previous plea was not guilty. Each charge against Ceglia could put him behind bars for up to 20 years. He is scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, November 28. Facebook declined to comment on Ceglia's indictment, but a Facebook spokesman told Mashable of Ceglia's case against the company and its CEO in April that \"this is a fraudulent lawsuit brought by a convicted felon, and we look forward to defending it in court. From the outset, we have said that this scam artist's claims are ridiculous, and this newest complaint is no better.\" A later court filing by Facebook's legal team called Ceglia's lawsuit a \"brazen and outrageous fraud on the court.\" It also labeled Ceglia an \"inveterate scam artist.\" Photo Credit Bloomberg Contributor Bloomberg Bloomberg via Getty Images <doc_sep> The latest in a string of lawyers who have represented a man in a multibillion lawsuit against Facebook is expected to ask a federal judge Tuesday for permission to withdraw from the case. Ohio attorney Dean Boland filed the request last month, a few days after his client, Paul Ceglia, was arrested on criminal charges accusing him of doctoring and destroying evidence to support his civil suit. Ceglia has pleaded not guilty. The request also comes as a motion by Facebook seeking to have Ceglia's lawsuit thrown out is pending. Boland has not publicly said why he wants to withdraw, only that it has nothing to do with any belief that Ceglia engaged in fraud. He submitted his detailed reasons privately to the judge. Attorneys for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook have asked the judge to make the reasons public, or at least disclose the reasons to them. Facebook will not oppose Boland's motion as long as it does not delay the case, the attorneys said in court filings. At least a half dozen lawyers and firms have withdrawn as Ceglia's attorney before Boland. Their reasons have not been publicly disclosed. Tuesday's hearing is expected to be conducted by telephone. Facebook's attorneys from the firm Gibson, Dunn Crutcher are based in New York City, while Boland's office is in Lakewood, Ohio. Ceglia also is represented by attorney Paul Argentieri of Hornell. Ceglia's 2010 lawsuit claims that he and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in 2003 signed a software development contract that included a provision entitling Ceglia to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for 1,000 in startup money for Zuckerberg's then-fledgling idea. Zuckerberg counters the document he signed had only to do with a street-mapping database called Streetfax that Ceglia had hired Zuckerberg, then a Harvard University student, to help develop. Earlier this year, attorneys for Facebook and Zuckerberg filed a motion to have Ceglia's lawsuit dismissed, asserting that Ceglia had forged documents, fabricated emails and destroyed evidence. They also said he had waited too long _ six years _ to bring his claim and the statute of limitations had expired.",

In May, the first lady was caught on camera clearly swatting away her husband's hand during a trip to Tel Aviv, Israel.

He then tried to tap her with his index finger like a middle schooler on a first date at a screening of Avengers: Infinity War, testing the waters to see if this was a good moment for some butter-fingered hand-holding. It was not. The first lady, in a wide-brimmed white hat like Olivia Pope except the exact opposite, did not get the message, so the president resorted to lightly worming his pinkie finger into her palm like an unsubtle Russian bot showing up in your timeline bearing a conspiracy theory and a donation link. Regular person stuff.

Co-president Mark Borde asserted \"Old Fashioned\" is the first faith-based theatrical release to specifically target the \"underserved\" Christian singles audience. Producers are Swartzwelder's Skoche Films, Nathan Nazario of Motion Picture Pro Studios, Dave DeBorde and Nini Hadjis.

A Faith-Based Romantic Drama Wants To Take Down 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' There is a faith-based film about \"old-fashioned courtship\" hitting theaters on the exact same day as the sinful, S M-filled; adaptation of \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" And if you thought that was some sort of divine coincidence, you would be wrong. This is a challenge. Freestyle Releasing the studio behind the equally wholesome \"God's Not Dead\" is rather openly marketing \"Old Fashioned\" as the anti- \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" or as it words it on its website the David to \"Fifty Shades'\" Goliath. The film, whose tagline promises that \"Chivalry is making a comeback,\" was written and directed Rik Swartzwelder, who also stars in the film as a former frat boy who falls for a \"free spirited woman\" played by Elizabeth Ann Roberts. According the the film's synopsis, together they attempt \"the impossible: an 'old-fashioned' courtship in contemporary America.\" Translation: no sex. Not even a little bit. None. Why, you ask? Well, according to Swartzwelder, \"Old Fashioned\" is about upholding a \"high standard in relationships.\" \"I wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of Godly romance seriously,\" he said. \"A story that, without apology, explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships; yet, is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and does not seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes.\" \"Old Fashioned\" hits theaters on Valentine's Day 2015. Choose your side. <doc_sep> Did you watch the Fifty Shades of Grey trailer and think \"hmm. There is certainly enough soft core porn-y looking shots of people not having sex. But it definitely needs more Jesus\"? Good, because there is a movie company that wants to fulfill your needs-not in that way though. Advertisement The filmmakers behind faith-based romance Old Fashioned want to take on potential box office monster Fifty Shades of Grey. But they are not worried about toppling box office records and taking down one of the most anticipated films of the year. Nope. They just want to provide a Christian alternative to a smutty film about people getting tied up and getting it on. Understandable.

The tagline of this film is \"chivalry makes a comeback,\" which means we will get lots of lessons on how romance is dead because us womenfolk are way to uppity with our careers and independence from men. We do not know how to let men be chivalrous because we are too \"free-spirited,\" like all those witches they burned in Salem. But much like Aerosmith in the 80s, chivalry is making a comeback.

    "document": "PERTH, Australia Search crews hunting for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet have failed to relocate faint sounds heard deep below the southern Indian Ocean that officials said were consistent with a plane's black boxes, the head of the search operation said Tuesday. Angus Houston, the retired Australian air chief marshal who is heading the search far off Australia's west coast, said sound locating equipment on board the Ocean Shield has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard late Saturday and early Sunday. Time may have already run out to find the devices, whose locator beacons have a battery life of about a month. Tuesday marks one month since the plane vanished. Once the beacons blink off, locating the black boxes in such deep water would be an immensely difficult, if not impossible, task. Up to 14 planes and 14 ships are scouring the 30,000-square-mile search zone. The wait has been devastating for weary families, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports. Many insist the search continues at all costs, despite the frustrations. It is unclear whether a sub on board the Ocean Shield will be deployed to try to chart out any debris on the sea floor when searchers are certain the black boxes' locator beacons have gone silent. If the sub maps out a debris field, the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage. Houston's comments about deploying the sub contradicted an earlier statement from Australia's acting prime minister, Warren Truss, who said search crews would launch the Bluefin 21 autonomous sub on Tuesday. The towed pinger locator detected late Saturday and early Sunday two distinct, long-lasting sounds underwater that are consistent with the pings from an aircraft's \"black boxes\" the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate. Still, officials warned it could take days to determine whether the sounds were connected to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 on board. \"This is an herculean task it is over a very, very wide area, the water is extremely deep,\" Defense Minister David Johnston said. \"We have at least several days of intense action ahead of us.\" Houtson said finding the sound again was critical to narrowing down the search area before the sub can be used. If the vehicle went down now with the sparse data collected so far, it would take \"many, many days\" for it to cover all the places the pings might have come from. \"It is literally crawling at the bottom of the ocean, so it is going to take a long, long time,\" Houston said. Despite the excitement surrounding the Ocean Shield's sound detections, Houston warned that the search had previously been marred by false leads such as ships detecting their own signals. Because of that, other ships cannot be sent in to help with the underwater search, as they may add unwanted noise. \"We are very hopeful we will find further evidence that will confirm the aircraft is in that location,\" Houston said. \"There is still a little bit of doubt there, but I am a lot more optimistic than I was one week ago.\" Finding the black boxes is key to unraveling what happened to the Boeing 777, because they contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings that could explain why the plane veered so far off-course. \"Everyone is anxious about the life of the batteries on the black box flight recorders,\" said Truss, who is acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is overseas. \"Sometimes they go on for many, many weeks longer than they are mandated to operate for we hope that will be the case in this instance. But clearly there is an aura of urgency about the investigation.\" The first sound picked up by the equipment on board the Ocean Shield lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost, Houston said. The ship then turned around and picked up a signal again this time recording two distinct \"pinger returns\" that lasted 13 minutes. That would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. The black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz, and the signals picked up by the Ocean Shield were both 33.3 kilohertz, YOU.S. Navy Capt. Mark Matthews said. But the manufacturer indicated the frequency of black boxes can drift in older equipment. Houston said the frequency of the sounds heard was considered \"quite credible\" by the manufacturer, and noted that the frequency from the Air France jet that crashed several years ago was 34 kilohertz. Pressure from being so deep below the surface and the age of the batteries can also affect the transmission level, he said. The frequency used by aircraft flight recorders was chosen because no other devices use it, and because nothing in the natural world mimics it, said William Waldock, a search-and-rescue expert who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. But these signals are being detected by computer sweeps, and \"not so much a guy with headphones on listening to pings,\" said YOU.S. Navy spokesman Chris Johnson. So until the signals are fully analyzed, it is too early to say what they are, he said. \"We will hear lots of signals at different frequencies,\" he said. \"Marine mammals. Our own ship systems. Scientific equipment, fishing equipment, things like that. And then of course there are lots of ships operating in the area that are all radiating certain signals into the ocean.\" The Ocean Shield is dragging a ping locator at a depth of 1.9 miles. It is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.12 miles, meaning it would need to be almost on top of the recorders to detect them if they were on the ocean floor, which is about 2.8 miles deep. Meanwhile, the search for any trace of the plane on the ocean's surface continued Tuesday. It is taking place 1,400 miles northwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth, with good weather predicted, said the Joint Agency Coordination Center, which is overseeing the operation. One-hundred-thirty-three missions have been completed so far in the hunt from the air for debris that could be from Flight 370, but no debris from the plane has been found. <doc_sep> 1 of 7. A fast response craft from Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield tows Able Seaman Clearance Diver Michael Arnold as he searches the ocean for debris in the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in this picture released by the Australian Defence Force April 8, 2014. SYDNEY PERTH, Australia Reuters An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search, officials said on Tuesday. Angus Houston, head of the Australian agency coordinating the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, said the month-long hunt in the Indian Ocean was at a critical stage given the batteries in the black box beacons had already reached the end of their 30-day expected life. A YOU.S. Navy \"towed pinger locator\" onboard Australia's Ocean Shield picked up two signals consistent with black box locator beacons over the weekend the first for more than two hours and the second for about 13 minutes. Houston said the signals represented the best lead in the search yet, but efforts to pick up the pings again had so far been unsuccessful. \"If we do not get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time. It is very slow, painstaking work,\" said Houston. The black boxes record cockpit data and may provide answers about what happened to the plane, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on March 8 and flew thousands of kilometers off its Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing route. Authorities say evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests the plane was deliberately diverted by someone familiar with the aircraft, but have not ruled out mechanical problems. Analysis of satellite data led investigators to conclude the Boeing 777 came down in an area some 1,680 km 1,040 miles northwest of Perth, near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused. BLUEFIN ON HOLD An autonomous underwater vehicle AUV named Bluefin-21 is onboard the Ocean Shield and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor, but narrowing the search zone first was critical, Houston said. \"It is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search, and of course, it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" he said. \"That is why it is so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there is absolutely no chance the black box device is still transmitting.\" The Bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft, before its findings are downloaded and analyzed on board the Ocean Shield. If anything unusual is spotted, the sonar on board the robotic vehicle will be replaced with a camera to take a closer look. The potential search area is about 4.5 km 2.8 miles deep, the outer reach of the Bluefin's range. Some 133 missions have been completed so far in the multinational aerial hunt for debris in the southern Indian Ocean and would continue, officials said. Up to 11 military planes, three civilian planes and 14 ships planned to take part in the search on Tuesday, with good weather in the search area. But so far, searchers have only turned up fishing gear and other detritus. \"Even after the black box is found, the surface search will continue because they are looking for evidence to investigate why the aircraft went down,\" Lieutenant Commander Adam Schantz, the officer in charge of YOU.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon search unit, told Reuters. \"So, we will continue for a while trying to find anything on the surface that might give a reasoning behind the accident.\" Additional reporting by Jane Wardell in Sydney and Anuradha Raghu in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Dean Yates and Michael Perry",

That is particularly worrying since the batteries on the jet's black boxes have likely just about run out. But \"we need to continue searching for several days right up to the point at which there is absolutely no doubt that the batteries will have expired,\" says Angus Houston, the Australian official leading the search, per CBS News. \"If we do not get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time,\" Houston says.

    "document": "What is Vote With Your Purse? Vote With Your Purse is a nationally acclaimed research study that examines trends in women's political giving and financial power, women's political fundraising results in election years, as well as provides concrete ideas on how to tap the \"power of the purse\" for the 2012 elections and beyond. She Should Run has identified a historic opportunity to fundamentally change women's approach to political giving. Lesson Learned: Women, Money, and Politics in the 2010 Election Cycle. While women's votes have been critical in deciding federal elections since the 1980's, women still face significant barriers towards realizing equality in politics and public life. In 2010, our nation experienced the first backslide in electing more women to office in over 30 years. In the same year, it also experienced a decrease in women's political giving, after securing very marginal increases in past elections. She Should Run, working with the Center for Responsive Politics CRP found that women still lag drastically behind men in political giving. In 2010, women made up just 26 of recorded federal political contributions to candidates, political action committees PACs and party committees. More importantly, this is down from 31 in the 2008 cycle and down from 30 in the 2006 cycle. This report reveals a probable correlation between women's political giving and their representation in Congress. It is telling that women's political giving went down during the same cycle that women's representation in Congress decreased. Our nation cannot afford these declines, given that women make up approximately 17 of Congress, yet represent over 50 of the population. The time is ripe for women to increase their political giving to match their economic and voting power. Key Findings Only 27 of total contributions to individual candidates were made by women, representing a 6.3 decrease from 2008 If women voters across parties give as little as 5 to one female candidate, it would be enough to run a female candidate in every House race with a budget of over 1 million each. In 2010, women made 30 of the total individual contributions to Democrats and just 25 of the total contributions to Republican candidates Women made just 21 of the total contributions to PACs in 2010, down 1.8 percentage points from 2008 Women made 38 of the 2010 individual contributions to the Democratic National Committee, while women made 24 of contributions to the Republican National Committee Despite the gender gap in political giving, female candidates are good fundraisers. In 2010, female House incumbents raised approximately 100,000 more than their male peers and female challengers raised over 74,000 more than male peers Why Do not Women Give? Data from past Vote with Your Purse reports explains women invest in political campaigns at lower rates because they do not think their money matters in showing support for a candidate and the issues they champion. Furthermore, women do not connect political leadership with positive, productive social change or view political giving as a civic responsibility. Based on these findings, She Should Run has developed the following suggestions for candidates working to increase contributions from women donors: Emphasize the impact they will have on specific issues Better inspire women by describing political giving as a civic or social responsibility, like voting or volunteering Provide multiple sources of independent information about their platform Include women in the process by making more transparent how the money will be used Provide opportunities for women donors to interact with campaign supporters and staff, and, of course, the candidate Download the Reports: Vote With Your Purse: Lesson Learned: Women, Money, and Politics in the 2010 Election Cycle Released: April 2012 Vote with Your Purse: Harnessing the Power of Women's Political Giving Update Released: June 2009 Vote With Your Purse: Harnessing the Power of Women's Political Giving for the 2008 Election and Beyond Released: June 2007 Special Thanks Vote With Your Purse would not have been possible without our donors, including among others: <doc_sep> Apparently it is still a man's world when it comes to donating to political campaigns. A new report on political donation reveal that women lag significantly behind their male counterparts when it comes to opening their wallets for politicians and political causes. The report, released Tuesday by She Should Run SSR and the Center for Responsive Politics CRP found that women represented just 26 percent of the total given to candidates, political action committees PACs and party committees in 2010, down from 31 percent in 2008 and 27 percent in 2006. Indeed, while the last three decade have seen women's income rise more than 60 percent, women are consistently comprising less than one-third of all political donations. According to Sam Bennett, president and CEO of SSR, women do not see the correlation between politics and their own desired social change in the same way men do, and they are turned off by the dirty nature of the political game. \"Women are far more motivated to want to see changes in their neighborhood and city on a social level than men are, but they have not yet made that connection with politics Bennett told The Daily Caller. \"In fact, women, far more than men, see the hard, sausage-making dimension of politics as something they are not willing to be engaged in. They find it distasteful.\" Ironically, while women are less likely to donate, female candidates are better fundraisers than their male counterparts. The report reveals that in 2010, on average, female House incumbents raised about 100,000 more than their male colleagues, and female challengers raised over 74,000 more than male peers. Bennett pointed to a 2011 study published in the American Journal of Political Science \"Jackie and Jill Robinson Effect: Why Do Congresswomen Outperform Congressmen?\" to explain the discrepancy between the fundraising numbers of male and female politicians. \"The truth of the matter is it is so rare to have a female in elected office in this country that she by definition she by nature is going to be a rock star. She is going to work harder by definition. She is going to be better at what she does,\" Bennett said. \"For her to have succeeded in the Wild Wild West of American politics, as a woman, she is a better performer, she works harder. And that is what you see in fundraising. Fundraising, counter to public belief, is not so much a reflection of talent, but of sheer hard work.\" While women are good fundraisers, they are not raising their money from other women. According to the report, just four of the 2,215 candidates that ran in 2010 relied on donations from women for more than 50 percent of their campaign contributions. Further, when women do donate they are slightly more likely to give to more Democratic candidates or endeavors. Last cycle, women made up 34 percent of the contributions to Democratic committees, 23 percent of those to Republican committees and 18 percent to third party committees. The mission of SSR is to encourage more women to get involved and run for office. According to Bennett, the hesitation of women to get involved in politics is detrimental to their issues receiving attention. \"When women run they win at equal rates as men, and when they run they now raise more money than men. What is the problem? They are not running. What is the problem? They are not giving politically.\" The report explains that the best way to get women involved is to make the connection between women's political dollars and the issues about which they are concerned. Bennett predicted, however, that more women will likely get involved this cycle due to the large number of pro-life bills that passed in 2011 and 2012 by state legislators, seeing the issue as motivation to get involved.

    "generated_summary": "A new report by She Should Run and the Center for Responsive Politics has found that women are less likely to donate to political campaigns than their male counterparts, reports the Daily Caller. \"Fundraising, counter to public belief, is not so much a reflection of talent, but of sheer hard work,\" says the report, which cites a 2011 study that found women raised more than 74,000 more than men in 2010. \"For her to have succeeded in the Wild Wild West of American politics, as a woman, she is a better performer, she works harder. And that is what you see in fundraising. Fundraising is counter-to public belief.\" The report notes that women make up just 26 of federal political contributions to candidates, political action committees PACs, and party committees, down from 31 in the 2008 cycle and 30 in the 2006 cycle. \"The truth of the matter is it is so rare to have a female in elected office in this country that she by definition she by nature is going to be a rock star,\" the report says, noting that women's political giving went down during the same cycle as women's representation in Congress decreased. \"Our nation cannot afford these declines, given that Women make up approximately 17 of Congress, yet represent over 50 of the population,\" the study states. The report says women are better fundraisers than men, but they are not raising their money from other women. \"When women run they win at equal rates as men, and when they run they now raise more money than men. What is the problem? They are not running,\" says a woman who is running for president.",

    "document": "Story highlights YOU.S. begins aid drops to Iraqi town surrounded by ISIS, the Pentagon says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS has sold Yazidi girls and women About 300 have been abducted, the rights group says Syria monitors: ISIS sees them as \"captives of the spoils of war with the infidels\" The United States says it has carried out airstrikes and dropped humanitarian aid in the Iraqi town of Amerli to protect an ethnic minority that one official says faces the threat of an \"imminent massacre.\" The town of Amerli, which has been besieged by ISIS fighters, is home to many of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen. To help the trapped people, the United States has carried out humanitarian airdrops, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said late Saturday. Australia, France and the UK also participated in the aid drop. The YOU.S. military conducted \"coordinated airstrikes\" against ISIS targets as part of an effort to support the humanitarian operation, Kirby said. Video released by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense was strikingly similar to the scenes of the dire situation faced by the Yazidis, who were trapped on the Sinjar Mountains by ISIS, earlier this month. Dozens of people crowded helicopters, hoping to be rescued. Scores more awaited the arrival life-saving supplies in the scorching summer sun. ISIS fighters have surrounded Amerli 70 miles north of Baquba, since since mid-June. The town's fewer than 20,000 residents are without power. \"Residents are enduring harsh living conditions with severe food and water shortages, and a complete absence of medical services and there are fears of a possible imminent massacre,\" YOU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said last week. ISIS has called the Shiite Turkmen heretics and vowed to push them out. Turkmen are descendants of a Turkic-speaking, traditionally nomadic people, who share culture ties with Turkey. There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3 of Iraq's population. Turkmen have been subjected to violence before at the hands of Sunni extremists. A truck bomb explosion in 2008 Amerli killed more than 100 people an attack that was considered one of the single deadliest attacks of the Iraq War at the time. Report: ISIS selling Yazidi women in Syria Hundreds of Yazidi women abducted by ISIS have either been sold or handed out to members of the Sunni extremist group, according to an organization that monitors the crisis. In the past few weeks, ISIS has \"distributed\" to its rank and file about 300 female members of the persecuted religious minority, says the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group aligned with the opposition in Syria. Those women were initially kidnapped in Iraq before being taken to Syria. In ISIS' eyes, the girls and women are \"captives of the spoils of war with the infidels,\" the Syria monitors said, claiming that some had converted to Islam so ISIS fighters can marry them. SOHR says it could confirm at least 27 cases in which women were \"sold and married\" for about 1,000 each to ISIS militants in Aleppo and Raqqa suburbs and Al-Hassakah.

They became trapped on the mountain, leading to air drops of water, food and other supplies, and eventually airstrikes to dislodge ISIS from the area. Peshmerga forces managed to help most of the Yazidis escape into Iraqi Kurdistan. YOU.S. President Barack Obama declared an end to the ISIS siege at Mount Sinjar on August 15, citing the success of the airstrikes. Since early August, nearly 122,600 people in the Sinjar district mostly Yazidis have taken refuge in Kurdistan, according to USAID A YOU.N. report warned of increasing kidnappings by armed groups in Mosul and the area of Mount Sinjar. The YOU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR reported that some of the victims reportedly have been forced to convert to Islam and have been trafficked by the terrorist groups inside and outside of Iraq. A number of villages in Sinjar remain besieged by ISIS and other armed groups, the refugee agency reported. ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, was previously referred to as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Attacks across Iraq At least three Iraqi soldiers were killed Saturday in a suicide car bombing south of Iraq's capital, police said, dealing a blow to the military in that area for a second straight day as government forces fight ISIS militants across the country. Seven other soldiers were injured in the attack, which happened at an army checkpoint in Yousifiya, a predominantly Sunni Muslim area about 35 kilometers 22 miles south of Baghdad, police in Baghdad said. It was not immediately clear who conducted the bombing. The blast came a day after nine Iraqi soldiers and Shiite Muslim militiamen were killed in clashes with suspected ISIS militants in nearby Mahmoudiya, a Sunni Muslim community about 29 kilometers south of Baghdad. During the height of Iraq's insurgency last decade following a YOU.S.-led invasion, Yousifiya and Mahmoudiya, along with the town of Latifiya, made up the Sunni area known as the \"Triangle of Death\" because it was an al Qaeda stronghold and a lair for criminals. Iraqi forces under a Shiite-led regime, as well as ethnic Kurdish forces, have been battling ISIS, which this year took over large portions of northern and western Iraq and eastern Syria for what it calls its new caliphate. Well before ISIS made gains, Iraq was beset for years by sectarian violence, with Sunnis feeling politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government since the YOU.S.-led ouster of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in 2003. More YOU.S. airstrikes YOU.S. forces conducted more airstrikes against ISIS targets near the Mosul on Saturday, according to the YOU.S. military, destroying a militant fighting position and armed vehicle. \"The strikes were conducted under the authority to support Iraqi security force and Kurdish defense force operations, as well as to protect critical infrastructure, YOU.S. personnel and facilities, and support humanitarian efforts,\" YOU.S. Central Command said in a press release. CENTCOM said it has carried 115 strikes across Iraq. <doc_sep> Keith Alexander, the recently retired director of the National Security Agency, left many in Washington slack-jawed when it was reported that he might charge companies up to 1 million a month to help them protect their computer networks from hackers. What insights or expertise about cybersecurity could possibly justify such a sky-high fee, some wondered, even for a man as well-connected in the military-industrial complex as the former head of the nation's largest intelligence agency? The answer, Alexander said in an interview Monday, is a new technology, based on a patented and \"unique\" approach to detecting malicious hackers and cyber-intruders that the retired Army general said he has invented, along with his business partners at IronNet Cybersecurity Inc., the company he co-founded after leaving the government and retiring from military service in March. But the technology is also directly informed by the years of experience Alexander has had tracking hackers, and the insights he gained from classified operations as the director of the NSA, which give him a rare competitive advantage over the many firms competing for a share of the cybersecurity market. The fact that Alexander is building what he believes is a new kind of technology for countering hackers has not been previously reported. And it helps to explain why he feels confident in charging banks, trade associations, and large corporations millions of dollars a year to keep their networks safe. Alexander said he will file at least nine patents, and possibly more, for a system to detect so-called advanced persistent threats, or hackers who clandestinely burrow into a computer network in order to steal secrets or damage the network itself. It was those kinds of hackers who Alexander, when he was running the NSA, said were responsible for \"the greatest transfer of wealth in American history\" because they were routinely stealing trade secrets and competitive information from YOU.S. companies and giving it to their competitors, often in China. Alexander is believed to be the first ex-director of the NSA to file patents on technology that is directly related to the job he had in government. He said that he had spoken to lawyers at the NSA, and privately, to ensure that his new patents were \"ironclad\" and did not rely on any work that he would done for the agency which still holds the intellectual property rights to other technology Alexander invented while he ran the agency. Alexander is on firm legal ground so long as he can demonstrate that his invention is original and sufficiently distinct from any other patented technologies. Government employees are allowed to retain the patents for technology they invent while working in public service, but only under certain conditions, patent lawyers said. If an NSA employee's job, for instance, is to research and develop new cybersecurity technologies or techniques, then the government would likely retain any patent, because the invention was directly related to the employee's job. However, if the employee invented the technology on his own time and separate from his core duties, he might have a stronger argument to retain the exclusive rights to the patent. \"There is no easy black-and-white answer to this,\" said Scott Felder, a partner with the law firm Wiley Rein LLP in Washington, adding that it is not uncommon for government employees to be granted patents to their inventions. A source familiar with Alexander's situation, who asked not to be identified, said that the former director developed this new technology on his private time, and that he addressed any potential infractions before deciding to seek his patents. But Alexander started his company almost immediately after stepping down from the NSA. As for how much the highly classified knowledge in his head influenced his latest creation, only Alexander knows. In the interview, Alexander insisted that the cybersecurity technology he is inventing now is distinct enough from his work at the NSA that he can file for new patents and reap all the benefits that come with them. A patent prohibits any other individual, company, or government agency from using the underlying invention without a license from the patent holder. But even if Alexander's new technology is legally unique, it is shaped by the nearly nine years he spent running an intelligence colossus. He was the longest-serving director in the history of the NSA and the first commander of the YOU.S. Cyber Command, responsible for all cybersecurity personnel defensive and offensive in the military and the Defense Department. From those two perches, Alexander had access to the government's most highly classified intelligence about hackers trying to steal YOU.S. secrets and disable critical infrastructure, such as the electrical power grid. Indeed, he helped to invent new techniques for finding those hackers and filed seven patents on cybersecurity technologies while working for the NSA. Alexander used his influence to warn companies that they were blind to cyberthreats that only the NSA could see, and that unless they accepted his help, they risked devastating losses. Alexander wanted to install monitoring equipment on financial companies' websites, but he was rebuffed, according to financial executives who took part in the discussions. His attempts to make the NSA a cyber-watchdog on corporate networks were seen as a significant intrusion by government into private business. Few, if any, independent inventors have seen such detailed, classified information about the way hackers work and what classified means the government has developed to fight them, all of which gives Alexander a competitive advantage in his new life as a businessman. That insider knowledge has raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Alan Grayson D-Fla. has publicly questioned whether Alexander is effectively selling classified information in exchange for his huge consulting fee. Bloomberg reported that the figure dropped to 600,000 after the 1 million figure raised hackles in Washington and among computer-security experts. Alexander said that his new approach is different than anything that is been done before because it uses \"behavioral models\" to help predict what a hacker is likely to do. Rather than relying on analysis of malicious software to try to catch a hacker in the act, Alexander aims to spot them early on in their plots. Only the market will tell whether his approach is as novel as he claims. One former national security official with decades of experience in security technology, and who asked to remain anonymous, said the behavioral-model approach is highly speculative and has never been used successfully. The former NSA chief said that IronNet has already signed contracts with three companies which he declined to name and that he hopes to finish testing the system by the end of September. \"We have got a great solution. We have got to prove that it works,\" Alexander said. \"It will be another way of looking at cybersecurity that gives us greater capabilities than we have had in the past.\" Asked why he did not share this new approach with the federal government when he was in charge of protecting its most important computer systems, Alexander said the key insight about using behavior models came from one of his business partners, whom he also declined to name, and that it takes an approach that the government had not considered. It is these methods that Alexander said he will seek to patent. Alexander said that if he determines that he needs to use technology or methods that the NSA has patented, he will pay for a license, including for anything he helped to invent while he was in office and for which he does not own the rights. During his time at the NSA, Alexander said he filed seven patents, four of which are still pending, that relate to an \"end-to-end cybersecurity solution.\" Alexander said his co-inventor on the patents was Patrick Dowd, the chief technical officer and chief architect of the NSA. Alexander said the patented solution, which he would not describe in detail given the sensitive nature of the work, involved \"a line of thought about how you would systematically do cybersecurity in a network.\" That sounds hard to distinguish from Alexander's new venture. But, he insisted, the behavior modeling and other key characteristics represent a fundamentally new approach that will \"jump\" ahead of the technology that is now being used in government and in the private sector. Alexander said he was persuaded to start a security business and apply for patents after hearing from potential customers, including company executives, who said they were worried about hackers who could steal or even erase the proprietary data on their companies' computers. Alexander said they were particularly worried about threats like the Wiper virus, a malicious computer program that targeted the Iranian Oil Ministry in April 2012, erasing files and data. That will come as a supreme irony to many computer security experts, who say that Wiper is a cousin of the notorious Stuxnet virus, which was built by the NSA while Alexander was in charge in cooperation with Israeli intelligence. The program disabled centrifuges in a nuclear plant in Iran in a classified operation known as Olympic Games. The United States has never acknowledged its involvement. The United States is not the only government capable of building data-erasing malware. Iran is building a formidable cyber-army, YOU.S. intelligence officials say, and is believed to be behind a 2012 attack on an oil company in Saudi Arabia that erased data from more than 30,000 computers. Iranian hackers also launched a series of cyberattacks on major YOU.S. bank websites the same year, intelligence officials say. The strike took Washington by surprise because it was so sophisticated and aggressive. The hackers hijacked data centers consisting of thousands of computers each and used them to flood the bank websites with digital traffic, causing them to crash. Brendan Smialowski AFP <doc_sep> RIYADH, Saudi Arabia The king of Saudi Arabia has warned that extremists could attack Europe and the YOU.S. if there is not a strong international response to terrorism after Islamist extremists seized a wide territory across Iraq and Syria. While not mentioning any terrorist groups by name, King Abdullah's statement appeared aimed at drawing Washington and NATO forces into a wider fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and its supporters in the region. Saudi Arabia openly backs rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad, but is concerned that the breakaway al Qaeda group could also turn those very same weapons on the kingdom. \"I am certain that after a month they will reach Europe and, after another month, America,\" he said at a reception for foreign ambassadors Friday. Official Saudi media carried the king's comments early Saturday. \"These terrorists do not know the name of humanity and you have witnessed them severing heads and giving them to children to walk with in the street,\" the king said, urging the ambassadors to relay his message directly to their heads of state. CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman reports from Washington that President Obama did not talk military planning Friday night when he met with Democratic donors, but he said that he understands that Americans are anxious about the growing threat of ISIS, and he acknowledged that it is a dangerous time in the Middle East. A day after the president said that he does not have a strategy yet for confronting ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, in Syria, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama is waiting for his defense secretary to present a plan. \"There are some who probably would make the case that it is OK to not have a formulated, comprehensive strategy but, just as one pundit I know recently suggested, that we could just go drop some bombs and see what happens,\" Earnest told reporters Friday. \"That is not what the president believes is a smart approach.\" Echoing that message, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said the Defense Department does not have binders full of plans at any given moment. \"Planners down in Tampa and planners here in the Pentagon continually refine and change and update planning options for potential military activity,\" Kirby told reporters Friday. \"It is an ongoing effort.\" The YOU.S. military campaign against ISIS is so far limited to targets in Iraq, but Mr. Obama is considering expanding the mission to also include Syria, where this week he ordered surveillance flights. ISIS has been fighting moderate rebels, other extremists and Assad's forces in Syria for nearly three years. Iraq has faced an onslaught by the Sunni extremists and their supporters since early this year, and the country continues to be roiled by instability. While providing arms and support to Sunni militants in Syria, Saudi Arabia has denied directly funding or backing ISIS. British officials raised the country's terror threat level Friday to \"severe,\" its second-highest level, because of developments in Iraq and Syria, but there was no information to suggest an attack was imminent. The White House has said it does not expect the YOU.S. to bump up its terrorism threat warning level. Saudi Arabia, a major YOU.S. ally in the region, has taken an increasingly active role in criticizing ISIS. Earlier this month, the country's top cleric described ISIS and al Qaeda as Islam's No. 1 enemy and said that Muslims have been their first victims. State-backed Saudi clerics who once openly called on citizens to fight in Syria can now face steep punishment and the kingdom has threatened to imprison its citizens who fight in Syria and Iraq. A decade ago, al Qaeda militants launched a string of attacks in the kingdom aimed at toppling the monarchy. Saudi officials responded with a massive crackdown that saw many flee to neighboring Yemen. In the time since, the kingdom has not seen any massive attacks, though it has imprisoned suspected militants and sentenced others to death. Meanwhile Saturday, police in Iraq said a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden car into an army checkpoint in the town of Youssifiyah, killing 11 people, including four soldiers, and wounding at least 24 people. Youssifiyah is 12 miles south of Baghdad. Hours later, a roadside bomb targeting an army patrol killed two soldiers and wounded five in Latifiyah, a town 20 miles south of Baghdad. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to journalists. <doc_sep> Photo BEIRUT, Lebanon Members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have beheaded a Lebanese soldier who was one of 19 captured when militants seized a Lebanese border town for a few days this month. A video of the beheading was posted on social media sites on Saturday. The soldier, recognizable as Ali al-Sayyed, a Sunni Muslim from northern Lebanon, was shown blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back, writhing and kicking the dusty ground as a militant announced that he would be killed. Another militant then beheaded him. The Lebanese Army declined to comment, but security officials and members of ISIS confirmed the beheading. Hours later, the group posted a second video showing nine other soldiers begging for their lives urging their families to stage street protests to demand that Lebanese officials release Islamist prisoners, so the soldiers would not be killed. Earlier this month, Syrian militants, including members of ISIS and the Nusra Front, battled the Lebanese Army after a rebel commander, Imad Ahmad Jomaa, was arrested in Arsal, Lebanon, a town near the Syrian border. Mr. Jomaa was a commander in the Nusra Front who switched his affiliation to ISIS but remained popular among the Nusra fighters.

The group says the Sunni extremists sold off at least 27 of the women to other ISIS members in Syria for 1,000 each. Some of the women converted to Islam for the marriages.

    "document": "Image caption The earthquake devastated the city of L'Aquila and many surrounding villages The trial of six Italian scientists and a former government official for manslaughter over the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila has opened in the city. The 6.3 magnitude quake devastated the city and killed 309 people. Prosecutors allege the defendants gave a falsely reassuring statement before the quake after studying hundreds of tremors that had shaken the city. The defence argues that there is no way to predict major earthquakes even in a seismically active area. The prosecutors accuse the seven of \"negligence and imprudence. of having provided an approximate, generic and ineffective assessment of seismic activity risks as well as incomplete, imprecise and contradictory information\". As the trial opened, L'Aquila prosecutor Alfredo Rossini told reporters: \"We simply want justice.\" The defendants face up to 15 years in jail. Lawyers for civil plaintiffs who include the local council are seeking damages of 50m euros 45m The civil portion of the case will be heard alongside the criminal case. Only one of the seven defendants who include some of Italy's most distinguished geophysicists and members of the country's civil protection agency was present on the opening day of the trial, which has now been adjourned until 1 October. \"I thought it was important to be here because this is my land, and I also wanted to underline the professionalism and the quality of the other public officials,\" said Bernardo De Bernardinis, former vice-president of the Civil Protection Agency's technical department. \"I am from Abruzzo and I owe it to the people of this area.\" Killed in homes The seven defendants were members of a government panel, the Serious Risks Commission, tasked with assessing the risks after hundreds of low-level tremors had rattled the medieval city in the months before the earthquake struck. DEFENDANTS Franco Barberi head of Serious Risks Commission head of Serious Risks Commission Enzo Boschi former president of the National Institute of Geophysics former president of the National Institute of Geophysics Giulio Selvaggi director of the National Earthquake Centre director of the National Earthquake Centre Gian Michele Calvi director of European Centre for Earthquake Engineering director of European Centre for Earthquake Engineering Claudio Eva physicist physicist Mauro Dolce director of the the Civil Protection Agency's earthquake risk office director of the the Civil Protection Agency's earthquake risk office Bernardo De Bernardinis, former vice-president of the Civil Protection Agency's technical department A week before the quake, they issued a reassuring statement, while also saying that it was not possible to predict whether a stronger quake would occur. They also recommended stricter enforcement of anti-seismic measures, particularly in building construction. In the minutes of their meeting, held on 31 March 2009, Mr Bosci, the former president of the National Institute of Geophysics, is reported to have told the group that just because a number of small tremors had been observed, it did not mean that a major earthquake was on its way. Mr Barberi, who headed the Serious Risks Commission, was also reported as concluding that there was \"no reason to believe that a series of low-level tremors was a precursor to a larger event\". On the night of the quake, many people remained in their homes and died because of this advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived, says the BBC's David Willey in Rome. Vincenzo Vittorini, a doctor who founded the 309 Martyrs association after losing his wife and daughter in the disaster, said: \"No-one expected to be told the exact time of the quake. We just wanted to be warned that we were sitting on a bomb.\" The case has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Last year, more than 5,000 scientists signed an open letter to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in support of the defendants. A lawyer for Mr Eva, Alfredo Biondi, said the trial was not credible. \"This is a trial which opens on very shaky foundations. You cannot put science on trial,\" he said. <doc_sep> Italian scientists face jail over 2009 quake Top Italian scientists are set to go on trial today, accused of manslaughter by playing down the risks of the devastating 2009 earthquake in the central city of L'Aquila in a case that some see as an unfair indictment of science. Prosecutors allege that the seven defendants six leading scientists and a government official should have warned residents to flee their homes ahead of the April 6, 2009 quake that killed more than 300 people in the capital of Italy's Abruzzo region. The experts were members of a panel that had met six days before the quake to assess risks after hundreds of tremors had shaken the medieval walled city. At that meeting, the committee headed by Franco Barberi of the Civil Protection Agency analysed data on more than 400 low-magnitude tremors that shook the region during the previous four months and determined that the activity was not a prelude to a major quake. The experts are accused of giving overly reassuring information to the local residents who could have taken adequate protective measures if they had been properly informed. According to the indictment issued last May, the seven are suspected of \"negligence and imprudence. of having provided an approximative, generic and ineffective assessment of seismic activity risks as well as incomplete, imprecise and contradictory information.\" The seven include such prominent scientists as Enzo Boschi, until recently the president of Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology INGV or Claudio Eva, a physics professor at the University of Genoa. The experts had made it clear that it was not possible to predict whether a stronger quake would occur but had recommended stricter enforcement of anti-seismic measures, particularly regarding building construction. Many in the scientific community however argue that the case effectively amounts to putting science on trial. In an open letter sent to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, more than 5,000 scientists said the seven defendants essentially face criminal charges for failing to predict quakes, even though it remains technically impossible to pinpoint the time, location and strength of a future earthquake in the short term. \"This is a trial which opens on very shaky foundations. You cannot put science on trial,\" said Alfredo Biondi, Eva's lawyer, who recalled that his client had during the meeting of the expert panel stated that \"one cannot rule out a major quake\". The lawyer also slammed the \"absolute inconsistency of the prosecution\" which first blamed the experts for \"predicting the risk\" and then for \"failing to assess it\". But Vincenzo Vittorini, a doctor who founded the association \"309 martyrs\" and lost his wife and daughter in the disaster, said, \"I hope that this trial will change mindsets and will lead to greater attention given to communication on risks.\" \"No one expected to be told the exact time of the quake. We just wanted to be warned that we were sitting on a bomb,\" he added Some 120,000 people were affected by the L'Aquila quake, which also destroyed the city's historic centers and medieval churches. In the September 14 issue of the science weekly Nature focused on the L'Aquila trial, Thomas Jordan, head of the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting ICEF said the case raises a fundamentally important issue about risk assessment. Italy's INGV has for several years drawn up a map of seismic risks in Italy and L'Aquila has since 2006 been within the highest-risk zone.",

The group of experts met in 2009 to analyze the risk posed by the seismic activity, but did not find because to raise alarm.

    "document": "In August, the Federal Way Mirror in Washington State said of their close 30th District state house election, \"this race may be the most interesting to watch. Two good, smart candidates who know the issues and will run a very clean race.\" It was a race to watch, but not for the reason they predicted. The incumbent Democratic state Rep. Roger Freeman one of two black representatives in the state legislature died at the end of October at the age of 48. Around 15 percent of the district's voters had already mailed in their ballots, and at the end of Election night he had a six-point-lead over his Republican opponent, Jack Dovey. The death was so recent that most voters were simply unaware that it had happened, and voted for the incumbent or on a party line. Local news station KVAL spoke to one such person on Tuesday night. Voter Steven Hinz cast a ballot for Freeman because he did not know the candidate had died. \"I did not know that,\" he said. \"When did he pass away?\" Since Freeman would not be able to effectively serve his terms, the two counties that make up the 30th district will select a temporary legislator from three possibilities offered by local Democrats. A special election would then be held next year. Voters elect people whose hearts no longer thump to the beat of democracy more than you would think. Last year, Oregon voters elected a man to the Aberdeen City Council five months after he died. Missouri elected a dead man who was running unopposed to serve as county commissioner in 2010. Three weeks before the 2000 election, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash. When he won a Senate race against John Ashcroft, his widow was appointed to take his place. Hackensack High School Principal Joseph DeFalco died after the polls had opened in 2005, and was elected to the city council for a four-year term he could not complete, or even start. In 1998, a dead woman, Jacquelyn Morrow Lewis Ledgerwood, made it to a run-off in the Oklahoma Senate's Democratic primary. The New York Times reported at the time, <doc_sep> November 4, 2014 at 11:00 PM Roger Freeman, a Democratic state representative from Federal Way, appeared headed for victory Tuesday despite dying six days ago. Tuesday's ballot results put Freeman, a first-term incumbent for the 30th legislative district that spans parts of King and Pierce Counties, ahead by six percentage points over his Republican challenger, Jack Dovey. Freeman's apparent victory leaves a decision for filling the vacant House seat to the King and Pierce County Councils, which must jointly appoint a Democrat to replace Freeman for one year. Freeman's replacement will be chosen from three nominees put forward by Democratic Party officials in the 30th District. A special election would be set next year for voters to decide on a candidate to fill out the final year of the two-year House term. Freeman, 48, a public defender and former Federal Way City Council member, died Wednesday morning after a long battle with colon cancer. He is survived by a wife and two children. <doc_sep> UPDATE: Roger Freeman, who died last week, is leading his race for a seat in the state House of Representatives. Early results show Freeman is taking 53 percent of the vote. FEDERAL WAY, Wash. There is an unusual twist in the race for state house in the 30th district of Federal Way. The democratic incumbent died from cancer last week, but Rep. Roger Freeman's name is still on the ballot and he is still getting votes. Freeman was battling to retain his seat in the state legislature. He was also battling colon cancer that spread to his liver and lungs. He lost that battle last Wednesday \"It is a day to remember Roger Freeman. It is a day to remember how he made us feel,\" said Freeman's legislative director, Martin Moore. Jack Dovey is Freeman's Republican challenger. \"It is a tragic thing that happened,\" Dovey said. Freeman's name is still on the ballot and is still getting support. Voter Steven Hinz cast a ballot for Freeman because he did not know the candidate had died. \"I did not know that,\" he said. \"When did he pass away?\" Even though word of Freeman's death spread throughout the community last week, obviously not everyone knows about it. \"I voted for Freeman,\"said Robert Zielie, who also did not realize Freeman was dead. But Freeman's supporters still want folks to vote for him, because if he wins he would be replaced by a democrat. The democratic precinct leaders would offer three potential replacements to the county councils of King and Pierce counties who would select one. If no agreement is reached, the governor gets to choose. Dovey says he would rather see Freeman waving signs with him. \"It is a lot easier running against the person than the party,\" he said. So Freeman's campaign says vote for Roger even though he is no longer with us. \"I think that is something that he would personally want,\" Moore said. <doc_sep> 5 things to know about Washington state's election Share this story print email SEATTLE AP Washington voters will not be electing a governor or YOU.S. senator this election, but they will weigh in on issues like gun background checks and class sizes. And voters in central Washington will see a first for the state two members of the same party on the fall ballot in a congressional race. Here is a look at 5 things to know about the general election: GUN MEASURES: Voters will decide the fate of two competing gun background check initiatives. One, Initiative 594, seeks universal background checks on all sales and transfers, including private transactions and many loans and gifts. The other, Initiative 591, would prevent the state from expanding checks beyond the national standard. Like federal law, Washington law currently requires checks for sales or transfers by licensed dealers but not for purchases from private sellers, like those who sell at gun shows or to friends. No other state has a gun-related measure on the ballot this year, and millions of dollars have been pouring into the state, mostly in support of expanding background checks. I-591 also would prohibit the confiscation of firearms without due process. REPUBLICAN VERSUS REPUBLICAN: The most interesting congressional race in the state is also the one where one party is guaranteed to have the winner. Washington's 4th Congressional District features two Republicans on the fall ballot the first time that is happened in a federal race under the state's 'Top 2' primary system. Tea party favorite Clint Didier is in a tight contest against Dan Newhouse, backed by the Republican mainstream. Newhouse has said he would focus on central Washington priorities such as water conservation and cleaning up the giant Hanford Nuclear Reservation, while Didier ran largely against the political establishment in the nation's capital, including some fellow Republicans, who he terms \"RINOs,\" Republicans in name only. SENATE CONTROL: For the last two legislative sessions, Republicans have controlled state Senate with the help of two Democrats who left their party to caucus with the GOP. Republicans hope to gain outright control of the upper chamber following Tuesday's election. Currently, the state Senate is split 26-23, technically with the majority lying with Democrats. But in 2012, two Democrats joined the Republicans to form a mostly GOP-controlled coalition, sending Democrats to the minority. The Democrats need to win two or more seats to regain control of the Senate, but Republicans had strong showings in the primary. Unlike the Senate, the House has not changed majority in more than a decade. This election is not expected to be different. The Democrats in that chamber currently hold a 55-43 majority. CLASS SIZE: Voters in Washington state will vote yet again on class sizes. Education advocates are pushing a measure limiting class sizes, but opponents say Initiative 1351 could make a bad budget situation worse as lawmakers scramble to pay for court-ordered reforms. State financial experts believe the initiative would eventually cost the state about 2 billion a year to pay for thousands more teachers and other school staff. Washington voters overwhelmingly approved another class size reduction initiative in 2000, and 14 years later, lawmakers are just starting to pay that bill. This initiative is different, in both its scope and the way it was written. Initiative 1351 would set lower class sizes at every grade level. The previous initiative focused on the youngest grades. VOTE BY MAIL: Washington, like Oregon, is an all vote-by-mail state. But unlike Oregon where ballots have to be received by Election Day in Washington, ballots just have to be postmarked no later than Election Day or placed in an official ballot drop box by 8 p.m. Tuesday. That means that in some of the more competitive races, results may not be known for days as most counties will update vote counts only once a day. <doc_sep> SEATTLE An incumbent Democratic state representative in Washington was headed for a decisive re-election victory on Wednesday even though he died last week, results indicate. Roger Freeman, a first-term representative from Federal Way, a city between Seattle and Tacoma, had about 53 percent of the vote, compared to about 47 percent for his Republican challenger, Jack Dovey. Freeman, 48, died last week after a battle with cancer. His death came after ballots were mailed to Washington voters, where all voting is done by mail. \"This is extremely rare,\" said Brian Zylstra, a spokesman for the secretary of state's office. \"But there are protocols in place.\" Once all ballots are finalized in coming weeks, if Freeman wins the vote, Democrats still will hold on to his seat in the state House of Representatives, Zylstra said. Democrats in Freeman's district, which spans two counties, will select three names for a temporary replacement and the King and Pierce County councils will vote to appoint one of those candidates to the seat for one year, according to state election rules. The seat would be on the ballot in 2015 to fill out the remainder of the two-year term, the rules say. Should the Republican candidate win, he will take the seat in Olympia at the start of the next legislative session.

    "reference_summary": "Election results are still trickling in in Washington state it is a vote-by-mail-only state, KOMO News reports but it looks like voters are giving Democratic Rep. Roger Freeman of Federal Way a second term with about 53 of the vote, NBC News notes. There is just one problem: The 48-year-old Freeman died last week after a long battle with colon cancer, the Seattle Times reports. Many voters either did not know Freeman had died or had already sent in their ballots, the Washington Post reports. \"I did not know that. When did he pass away?\" one voter told KVAL. \"This is extremely rare,\" a spokesman for Washington's secretary of state tells NBC. \"But there are protocols in place.\" Those protocols would be much simpler if voters had simply elected the very much alive Republican candidate, Jack Dovey. However, since Freeman is apparently the victor, Democrats in the district will pick three names to serve as his temporary replacement; the county councils will then vote one of those candidates in to serve for one year, with a special election next year to pick someone for the final year of the two-year term, NBC notes. Dovey, now known as the challenger beat by a deceased candidate, simply tells KVAL, \"It is a tragic thing that happened.\" This county candidate dropped out of the race after his dead friend supposedly voted for him.",

The YOU.S. Senate mail facility is currently closed for more testing all mail bound for Capitol Hill is now being directed through a YOU.S. House facility. The letter was postmarked Memphis, Tenn., and had no suspicious markings or return address, according to a message sent to congressional staffers by Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer. Gainer indicated that the Senate mail facility would be closed for two to three days \"while testing and the law enforcement investigation continues.\" Also on POLITICO: Napolitano: No sign of 'broader plot' Sen. Claire McCaskill D-Mo. said members were briefed that the substance had been found in a letter and that a suspect has been identified. McCaskill said the letter came from an individual who frequently writes to lawmakers. She would not identify the person but confirmed officials were investigating someone. McCaskill said state offices have been told what to look for if there are more letters containing the toxic substance. Also on POLITICO: What is ricin? The Senate went into recess shortly after 6 p.m. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and FBI Director Robert Mueller began briefing senators shortly afterward about the incident. A Homeland Security official said that the briefing was intended to address cybersecurity but that the subject pivoted after the ricin substance was discovered. All congressional mail is screened ever since Capitol Hill-bound letters laced with anthrax were discovered in October 2001, which contributed to the death of five people and infected 17 more. Senate offices were closed for several days in 2004 when ricin was found in the offices of then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist R-Tenn. Follow politico <doc_sep> Federal officials discovered Tuesday a poison-laced letter sent to Sen. Roger Wicker R-Miss. uncovering the material at an off-site location where congressional mail has been screened since anthrax-laced letters were sent to Capitol Hill in 2001. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid D-Nev. and other senators exiting an FBI briefing on the Boston attacks, told reporters that the letter was tested at the facility and came up positive for ricin. Officials gave no indication why the letter was sent to Wicker, a low-profile senator in his second term. <doc_sep> Story highlights Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of ricin, Senate official says The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address It was addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans An envelope that tested positive for the deadly poison ricin was intercepted Tuesday afternoon at the YOU.S. Capitol's off-site mail facility in Washington, congressional and law enforcement sources tell CNN. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was told the letter was addressed to the office of Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer. However, the FBI said additional testing is needed as field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results. \"Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,\" according to the bureau. \"Those tests are in the process of being conducted and generally take from 24 to 48 hours.\" A law enforcement source said more tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides. Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters after a briefing for lawmakers that a suspect has already been identified in the incident, but a knowledgeable source said no one was in custody Tuesday night. Wicker, the junior senator from Mississippi, has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.

Patrick Leahy, among others. Senators were told the post office would be temporarily shut down \"to make sure they get everything squared away,\" McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon. \"The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,\" she said. Members will be warning their home-state offices to look out for similar letters, she added. A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said. Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms an amount the size of the head of a pin can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed. It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction. Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later. Wicker, 61, was first appointed by former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour to the YOU.S. Senate in December 2007 after the resignation of then-Sen. Trent Lott. He was then elected to the seat in 2008 and won re-election in 2012 to a second term. Before joining the Senate, he was a YOU.S. representative in the House from 1995 to 2007.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Updated By Andrew Blankstein A Pennsylvania man has been charged in the hacking of Apple and Google accounts belonging to more than 100 people, many of them celebrities, officials said on Tuesday. Between November 2012 and Sept. 2014, Ryan Collins, 36, sent fake emails that purported to be from Apple or Google, and got victims to unknowingly hand over their usernames and passwords, the YOU.S. Attorney for the Central District of California said. He then used that information to get into their email accounts, swiping nude photos in some instances, and sometimes downloading full backups from Apple's iCloud, prosecutors said in a charging document filed Tuesday. Police began probing an apparent iCloud hack that resulted in leaked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities, mostly women, in September of 2014. Collins, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was charged in Los Angeles with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, prosecutors said. The charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, but prosecutors will recommend a sentence of 18 months, the YOU.S. Attorney's Office said. There is an ongoing investigation into the hacking itself, as well as into the posting of the photos. There has not been any evidence that Collins himself posted any of the photos, or that he was directly involved in leaking them, officials said on Tuesday. Collins case will be transferred to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This is the first arrest in connection with the security breach. At least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts were compromised, officials said. \"By illegally accessing intimate details of his victims' personal lives, Mr. Collins violated their privacy and left many to contend with lasting emotional distress, embarrassment and feelings of insecurity,\" David Bowdich, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement. \"We continue to see both celebrities and victims from all walks of life suffer the consequences of this crime and strongly encourage users of Internet-connected devices to strengthen passwords and to be skeptical when replying to emails asking for personal information,\" he said.",

    "document": "CNN Usaamah Rahim, who was fatally shot after waving a military knife at law enforcement officers in Boston, was originally plotting to behead Pamela Geller, an activist and conservative blogger, law enforcement sources told CNN on Wednesday. But Rahim, a 26-year-old security guard who officials believe was radicalized by ISIS and other extremists, decided instead to target the \"boys in blue,\" a reference to police, according to court documents. \"I cannot wait that long,\" he said of the original beheading plan, according to an FBI affidavit filed in federal court in Boston Geller drew national attention last month after an off-duty police officer working security thwarted an attack at her organization's contest for Prophet Mohammed drawings in Garland, Texas. She is president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, which includes subsidiary programs Stop Islamization of America and Stop Islamization of Nations. \"They targeted me for violating Sharia blasphemy laws. They mean to kill everyone who does not do their bidding and abide by their law voluntarily,\" Geller told CNN's Erin Burnett after learning of the alleged plot. \"This is a showdown for American freedom. Will we stand against this savagery or bow down to them and silence ourselves?\" Geller said that she is had an \"army of security\" since last month's Texas incident. \"This is what is required just to show a cartoon in America, 2015,\" she said. \"It is striking. It is devastating, and people need to understand what is at stake. I mean, if we surrender on this point, what will we surrender next?\" 'The easiest target' About two hours before Rahim's confrontation Tuesday with officers on a Boston street, he allegedly told an associate he was \"going to go after them, those boys in blue. Because it is the easiest target,\" the documents say. Rahim's alleged associate, David Wright, 25, appeared in YOU.S. District Court in Boston to face a charge of obstructing a federal investigation by destroying electronic evidence on Rahim's smartphone. A detention hearing was scheduled for June 19 after prosecutors said he was a flight risk. Wright allegedly attempted to destroy Rahim's cell phone and conceal evidence of their plans, according to the documents. Wright faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted. Rahim purchased three military fighting knives with blades longer than 8 inches on Amazon.com, the court documents said. \"I just got myself a nice little tool,\" Rahim allegedly told his associate, according to the court documents. \"You know it is good for carving wood and carving sculptures.\" In a recorded conversation, the two men are then heard laughing. They apparently share some history. Under the alias \"Abu Sufyaan,\" Rahim thanked his nephew, \"Dawud Sharif Abdul-Khaliq,\" an alias of Wright, for witnessing his wedding, according to a 2013 Facebook post Wright's attorney called for caution. \"I would urge the government, the FBI and law enforcement, in investigating this case and related cases, to be as transparent as possible, and in enforcing the law, to abide by the law,\" Jessica Hedges told reporters. \"We have serious concerns about that already.\" 24-hour surveillance Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said surveillance video shows four or five officers approach Rahim without their weapons drawn. The officers backtrack as he comes after them and gets \"close enough to cause imminent harm.\" They eventually draw their weapons and open fire. \"We never anticipated what his reaction would be and that he would pull out a military knife and approach the officers,\" Evans said. Police released this image of a knife Usaama Rahim allegedly waved at officers before being fatally shot. Anti-terrorism authorities had Rahim under 24-hour surveillance, said Vincent B. Lisi, FBI special agent in charge. Rahim was a subject of a terror investigation involving suspected Islamist extremists, law enforcement sources said. \"We believe he was a threat,\" Evans said. \"He was someone we were watching for quite some time.\" The FBI noted a recent change in Rahim's behavior, including social media threats against police, which prompted agents to try to approach him, according to an official. Shooting video Authorities showed the surveillance video of the incident during an unusual meeting with religious and civil rights leaders in an attempt to allay community concerns about the shooting. Rahim was not on the phone at the time of the shooting and was not shot in the back, as had been reported by a relative, according to clergy and civic leaders who met with authorities earlier Wednesday. \"What the video does reveal to us very clearly is that the individual was not on the cell phone, the individual was not shot in the back and that the information reported by others that that was the case was inaccurate,\" Darnell Williams, president and chief executive of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, said at a news conference with the police commissioner and others. Rahim's brother has posted on social media that the suspect was on the phone with their father and was shot three times in the back during the confrontation with police. Williams said prosecutors want Rahim's family to see the video before showing it to the public. The religious and civic leaders said Rahim appeared to be shot three times in the shoulder, abdomen and chest. Police had earlier reported that he was struck two times. Imam Abdullah Faaruuq, speaking for the Muslim community, said the video was inconclusive. \"I do not think that he was shot in the back. However we could not see clearly at all,\" he said. He added, \"We cannot say what happened. We were not there. We do see a very vague video that is not clear as to what transpired. It was not at a bus stop. He was not shot in the back and there is not detail enough on the video to tell us exactly what happened.\" A third associate The FBI-led task force had been watching Rahim and two associates also believed to be radicalized, according to a law enforcement official. Rahim had been monitored for at least a couple of years. Investigators were talking to the associates, and various locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island were being searched, officials said. The Rhode Island raid was connected to a third person believed to be associated with Wright and Usaamah Rahim, according to two federal law enforcement sources. The third person was connected by more than just an \"Internet relationship,\" one law enforcement source said. The sources did not provide a name for the individual they were investigating.

Associated Press Community members and police officials at Boston Police Department Headquarters prepare to see a video, Wednesday, June 3, 2015, in Boston, of a fatal police shooting on Tuesday, in the city's Roslindale. Associated Press Usaama Rahim plotted for at least a week to attack police, the FBI said in a complaint against a family member who was arrested Tuesday, the day Rahim was shot to death. On Wednesday, the relative, David Wright, was ordered held on a charge of conspiracy with intent to obstruct a federal investigation. The FBI said Rahim, who had previously discussed beheadings, bought three fighting knives and a sharpener on or before May 26 and he told Wright on Tuesday he would begin trying to randomly kill police officers. An anti-terror task force of FBI agents and Boston police, faced with an imminent threat, confronted Rahim on a sidewalk and fatally shot him when he refused to drop his knife, authorities said. An affidavit written by an FBI agent assigned to Boston's Joint Terrorism Task Force refers to a recorded conversation between Rahim and Wright in which Wright made a comparison to \"thinking with your head on your chest.\" The FBI said that was a reference to Islamic State propaganda videos showing severed heads on the chests of beheading victims. The FBI affidavit said Rahim initially told Wright about a plan to behead someone outside Massachusetts. On Sunday, Rahim, Wright and an unidentified man met on a beach in Rhode Island to \"discuss their plans,\" the FBI affidavit said. \"Wright indicated that he agreed with Rahim's plan and supported it,\" the affidavit states. Authorities searched a home in Warwick, Rhode Island, on Tuesday and Wednesday but would not confirm the search was related to the investigation. They also would not confirm how Rahim, 26, and Wright, 24, are related. Early Tuesday morning, Rahim called Wright and told him he had changed his plans and no longer planned to kill someone in another state, the affidavit says. Instead, he said he was going to \"go after\" the \"boys in blue,\" it says, an apparent reference to police officers. During the recorded conversation, Rahim told Wright, \"Yeah, I am going to be on vacation right here in Massachusetts. I am just going to, ah, go after them, those boys in blue. Because, ah, it is the easiest target and, ah, the most common is the easiest for me,\" the affidavit says. The FBI said the phrase \"going on vacation\" refers to committing violent jihad. Authorities allege that during that conversation, Wright advised Rahim to destroy his smartphone, wipe his laptop computer and prepare his will. On Wednesday, authorities moved swiftly to manage perceptions of the shooting, which killed a black man whose family is well known among Muslims and African-Americans in Boston. Rahim's mother is a nurse at Boston University. His older brother, Ibrahim Rahim, is a scholar known for preaching after the Boston marathon bombings that violence is anti-Islamic. Ibrahim Rahim initially posted a message on Facebook alleging police repeatedly shot his brother in the back while he was on a cellphone calling their father for help. But his version unraveled Wednesday after police showed their video of the confrontation to community leaders. Darnell Williams, president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, said he could \"150 percent corroborate\" the police account. The images clearly show that Usaama Rahim \"was not on a cellphone and was not shot in the back,\" Williams said. Police Commissioner William Evans said officers confronted Rahim because \"military and law enforcement lives were at threat.\" The video, which police did not make available publicly, shows that Rahim menaced the officers with a large military-style knife and they initially backed away before shooting him when he refused to drop it, police said. Williams said he is not ready to call the shooting justifiable, and a Boston Muslim leader, Imam Abdullah Faaruuq, said it was unclear from the \"inconclusive\" video whether police had to use deadly force. \"They might have approached him in a different way,\" Faaruuq said. Ibrahim Rahim could not be reached for comment Wednesday as he traveled to Boston to bury his brother. Usaama Rahim was under investigation after spreading Islamic State propaganda online and communicating with other people about it, said YOU.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. \"These cases are a reminder of the dangers posed by individuals radicalized through social media,\" the Texas Republican said. Prosecutor Stephanie Siegmann said Wright posed a serious risk of fleeing or obstructing justice if not held pending a June 19 hearing. Wright's attorney, Jessica Hedges, denied that, saying he has deep roots in the Boston area and an \"incredibly loving and supportive family.\" Hedges urged the government to be \"as transparent as possible\" and \"abide by the law\" as it investigates this case, saying \"we have serious concerns about that already.\" Authorities quickly showed the video to black and Muslim community leaders. The meeting \"was all about pulling the community together,\" Evans said. After the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, Ibrahim Rahim described Jihadis who promote terror as \"hell-bent on Islam's destruction from within,\" and he urged fellow Islamic leaders to drive \"a mass recall of the rhetoric of hate and to suppress any and all human desire to harm others based on any contrived justification.\" Yusufi Vali, executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, where Usaama Rahim briefly worked as a guard, said Ibrahim Rahim \"is a great guy and preaches a very moderate form of Islam.\" Vali said Usaama Rahim did not regularly pray at the center and did not volunteer there or serve in any leadership positions. Boston voter registration records describe Rahim as a student. Other records show he applied for a security guard license in Florida in 2011 but did not follow through. A spokeswoman said Rahim had worked for CVS since March. Rahim's shooting is being investigated by the Suffolk district attorney's office and the FBI, routine for shootings involving police. The Council of American-Islamic Relations said it is monitoring them. The Black Community Information Center, an activist group in Boston, called for the YOU.S. Department of Justice to lead a more independent review. _ Associated Press writers Collin Binkley and Phil Marcelo contributed to this report from Boston, and Eric Tucker contributed from Washington. _ This story has been corrected to show the FBI alleges only Rahim, not Wright, bought three knives.",

    "document": "Mack Wolford, a flamboyant Pentecostal pastor from West Virginia whose serpent-handling talents were profiled last November in The Washington Post Magazine hoped the outdoor service he had planned for Sunday at an isolated state park would be a \"homecoming like the old days,\" full of folks speaking in tongues, handling snakes and having a \"great time.\" But it was not the sort of homecoming he foresaw. Instead, Wolford, who turned 44 the previous day, was bitten by a rattlesnake he owned for years. He died late Sunday. Mark Randall \"Mack\" Wolford was known all over Appalachia as a daring man of conviction. He believed that the Bible mandates that Christians handle serpents to test their faith in God and that, if they are bitten, they trust in God alone to heal them. He and other adherents cited Mark 16:17-18 as the reason for their practice: \"And these signs will follow those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\" The son of a serpent handler who himself died in 1983 after being bitten, Wolford was trying to keep the practice alive, both in West Virginia, where it is legal, and in neighboring states where it is not. He was the kind of man reporters love: articulate, friendly and appreciative of media attention. Many serpent-handling Pentecostals retreat from journalists, but Wolford did not. He would take them on snake-hunting expeditions. Last Sunday started as a festive outdoor service on a sunny afternoon at Panther Wildlife Management Area, a state park roughly 80 miles west of Bluefield, W.Va. In the preceding days, Wolford had posted several teasers on his Facebook page asking people to attend. \"I am looking for a great time this Sunday,\" he wrote May 22. \"It is going to be a homecoming like the old days. Good 'ole raised in the holler or mountain ridge running, Holy Ghost-filled speaking-in-tongues sign believers.\" \"Praise the Lord and pass the rattlesnakes, brother\" he wrote on May 23. He also invited his extended family, who had largely given up the practice of serpent handling, to come to the park. \"At one time or another, we had handled snakes but we had backslid,\" his sister, Robin Vanover, said Monday evening. \"His birthday was Saturday, and all he wanted to do is get his brothers and sisters in church together.\" And so they were gathered at this evangelistic hootenanny of Christian praise and worship. About 30 minutes into the service, his sister said, Wolford passed a yellow timber rattlesnake to a church member and his mother. \"He laid it on the ground,\" she said, \"and he sat down next to the snake, and it bit him on the thigh.\" A state forester, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said park officials were unaware of Wolford's activities. \"Had we known he had poisonous animals, we would have never allowed it,\" he said. The festivities came to a halt shortly thereafter, and Wolford was taken back to a relative's house in Bluefield to recover, as he always had when suffering from previous snake bites. By late afternoon, it was clear that this time was different, and desperate messages began flying about on Facebook, asking for prayer. Wolford got progressively worse. Paramedics transported him to Bluefield Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. It could not be determined when the paramedics were called. Wolford was 15 when he saw his father die at age 39 of a rattlesnake bite in almost exactly the same circumstances. \"He lived 101 2 hours,\" Wolford told The Washington Post last fall. \"When he got bit, he said he wanted to die in the church. Three hours after he was bitten, his kidneys shut down. After a while, your heart stops. I hated to see him go, but he died for what he believed in.\" According to people who witnessed Mack Wolford's death, history repeated itself. He was bitten roughly at 1:30 p.m.; he died about 11 that night. One of the people present was Lauren Pond, 26, a freelance photographer from the District. She had been photographing serpent handlers in the area for more than a year, including for The Post, and stayed at Wolford's home in November. \"He helped me to understand the faith instead of just documenting it,\" she said Tuesday. \"He was one of the most open pastors I have ever met. He was a friend and a teacher.\" The family allowed her to stay near Wolford's side Sunday night, and she is still recovering from having witnessed the pastor's agonizing death. \"I did not see the bite,\" she said. \"I saw the aftermath.\" In an interview with The Post for last year's story, Jim Murphy, curator of the Reptile Discovery Center at the National Zoo, described what happens when a rattlesnake bites. The pain is \"excruciating,\" he said. \"The venom attacks the nervous system. It is vicious and gruesome when it hits.\" But Wolford refused to fear the creatures. He slung poisonous snakes around his neck, danced with them, even laid down on or near them. He displayed spots on his right hand where copperheads had sunk their fangs. His home in Bluefield had a spare bedroom filled with at least eight venomous snakes: usually rattlers, water moccasins and copperheads that he fed rats and mice. He was passionate about wanting to help churches in nearby states including North Carolina and Tennessee, where the practice is illegal start up their own serpent-handling services. \"I promised the Lord I would do everything in my power to keep the faith going,\" he said in October. \"I spend a lot of time going a lot of places that handle serpents to keep them motivated. I am trying to get anybody I can get involved.\" His funeral will be held Saturday at his church, House of the Lord Jesus, in Matoaka, just north of Bluefield.

Vahid Mazloumin and another member of his currency trading network received the death penalty for \"spreading corruption on earth\". According to the Iranian Students' News Agency, Mr Mazloumin and associates had hoarded the coins to manipulate prices. Rights group Amnesty International described the executions as \"horrific\" and a violation of international law. \"Use of the death penalty is appalling under any circumstances,\" Amnesty said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that under international law \"the death penalty is absolutely forbidden for non-lethal crimes, such as financial corruption\". Amnesty went on to say that the manner in which the trials were \"fast-tracked\" displayed a \"brazen disregard\" for due process. How did these executions come about? Mr Mazloumin was arrested in July for operating as a speculator and accused of hoarding gold coins with the aim of later manipulating prices on the local market. In August, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved a judicial request to set up special courts to deal with those suspected of financial crimes. Since then, these courts have sentenced several people to death in trials often broadcast live on state television. The second man executed, who was also convicted of \"spreading corruption\", was linked to Mr Mazloumin's network and was reportedly involved in the sale of gold coins, according to Mizan, the official website of Iran's judiciary. Both men were executed by hanging. Why are gold coins in high demand in Iran? Demand for gold coins and US dollars in Iran has soared as the country's currency has declined in value. In the wake of the latest round of US sanctions on Iran, the rial has fallen about 70 against the US dollar, while gold coins have grown more expensive. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gold coins have increased in value as Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen As a result, a cost of living crisis has seen demonstrators take to the streets against perceived corruption. The tough US sanctions on Iran target the country's oil and finance sectors. Iran is heavily dependent on its exports of oil, and the renewed sanctions, if effective, would cause yet further damage to the economy. Tehran has been battling instability in its financial markets since April, when the government attempted to stabilise currency prices by introducing a single official dollar exchange rate. <doc_sep> Just a day earlier, traders said, about 130 small-time currency and gold dealers were arrested in downtown and the nearby Grand Bazaar. The rial was trading at 12,900 to the dollar on Wednesday, slightly better than the day before but down from about 40,000 a year ago.",

He and another financial trader, Mohammad Esmaeel Qasemi, were hanged after the Iranian Supreme Court upheld the convictions, the Los Angeles Times reports. A third person, who also was convicted, has an appeal pending. According to state media reports, Mazloumin, 58, amassed two tons of gold coins. He was reportedly arrested in July and later tried by a special court recently set up to adjudicate suspected financial crimes. Several other people, often in televised trials, have also been convicted and sentenced to death, according to reports. Earlier this year, financial traders in Iran did \"brisk business,\" per the Times, as financial mismanagement by the government and renewed US sanctions decimated the Iranian rial and many people traded their cash for dollars or gold. The Iranian government blamed traders for the currency crisis and shortages of basic items, such as medicine and diapers, leading to police raids and the establishment of the special courts for economic crimes. Amnesty International tells the BBC that the resulting executions are \"horrific,\" saying that international law forbids the death penalty for \"non-lethal crimes, such as financial corruption.\" Iran warns of \"war situation\" amid renewed sanctions.",

Our campaign, to seed The Beauty for Ashes Fund at PLNU with 40,000, is about hope. Sex and labor trafficking has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and around the world. PLNU's Center for Justice and Reconciliation CJR is engaged in the issue of human trafficking locally, nationally and internationally providing leadership in research and community organizing. As the CJR works with direct service providers, law enforcement and other movement leaders and when we talk to survivors, we keep hearing the same message survivors dream of a college education! Our campaign, to seed The Beauty for Ashes Fund at PLNU with 40,000, is about hope. Sex and labor trafficking has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and around the world. PLNU's Center for Justice and Reconciliation CJR is engaged in the issue of human trafficking locally, nationally and internationally providing leadership in research and community organizing. As the CJR works with direct service providers, law enforcement and other movement leaders and when we talk to survivors, we keep hearing the same message survivors dream of a college education! Securing the resources to fund a college education can seem impossible to a survivor. We do not think it should be. We believe one of the most critical components to the long-term rehabilitation of a survivor is a university education. And you can play a part. The money raised from this campaign will go to support the education of survivors of human trafficking. We look at it this way an education in the loving, academically challenging and carefully mentored environment of a Christian university can take someone from Victim to Survivor to Thriver. Our Goal and Your Part Here is the plan: The funds raised during our campaign will predominantly go toward the tuition, room and board of survivors who are accepted as students at PLNU. A small portion will go for student vocational discernment and an even smaller proportion for the administrative support of these students. It is our plan to fund more than one student. With other financial aid, 40,000 can go along way. But remember that this is only seed money! We will fund someone as early as September 2015 and already have survivors in the process of applying Your donation is tax deductible! Perks or No Perks? Crowdfund campaigns often focus on \"perks\". We have a different approach. We believe that you want the money to go to survivors, too, so we are banking on the fact that it is not the perks that will get you to participate it is making the dream a reality that matters. The perks we have are donated by campaign supporters. If we do not reach our goal of 40,000 PLNU will still receive all of the funds raised and all of the money raised will still go to the Beauty for Ashes Fund at PLNU. If we do not reach our goal of 40,000 PLNU will still receive all of the funds raised and all of the money raised will still go to the Beauty for Ashes Fund at PLNU. Because it Matters Did you know? Human trafficking is the act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud or coercion. Many do not know that it happens in our own neighborhoods, but it does. Possibly as close to you as the nearest high school or hotel. It is not just an immigrant issue, but involves scores of our own teens. It is organized, seductive and at times extremely violent, with traffickers representing every social and racial group, working independently and in nationwide rings. Using force, drugs, emotional tactics and financial methods to control their victims, the perpetrators abuse, coerce and control adults, youth and children as young as 12-14 years old. Facing the epidemic proportion of the problem of sex and labor trafficking is daunting. But from the highest levels of government to \"on the street\" direct service providers there is a movement sweeping our nation to end modern day slavery in America. More victims are being rescued. More perpetrators are being prosecuted. More organizations are stepping up to provide rescue, rehabilitation and a future for survivors. Why it Matters to Us Point Loma Nazarene University, in San Diego, California, is a nationally prominent Christian university. The university exists to provide higher education in a vital Christian community where minds are engaged and challenged, character is modeled and formed, and service becomes an expression of faith. It is precisely because of this mission that human trafficking matters to us. PLNU is an institution of the Church of the Nazarene. If you have looked into the roots of the Church of the Nazarene you will know that the church was founded on the principles of reaching the marginalized. It is who we are at our core always have been and always will be. With this Fund we are standing behind our mission statement, not just for the privileged youth of our culture, but also for the most vulnerable. We are a university for those who were once captives, as well as for those who want to set the captives free.

    "document": "WASHINGTON Pentagon investigators concluded that a senior Defense Department official who has been mentioned as a possible candidate to be the next CIA director leaked restricted information to the makers of an acclaimed film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and referred the case to the Justice Department, according to knowledgeable YOU.S. officials. The Justice Department received the case involving Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers in September, but so far it is declined to launch a criminal prosecution, said two senior YOU.S. officials who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The case involved a determination by investigators of the Pentagon's inspector general's office that Vickers provided the makers of the film \"Zero Dark Thirty\" with the restricted name of a YOU.S. Special Operations Command officer who helped plan the May 2, 2011, raid on bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan, one official said. The identities of special forces personnel can be classified in certain circumstances and making them public is against the law, according to experts. Vickers, a former Army special forces operator and onetime CIA paramilitary officer, is the top intelligence adviser to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and oversees the Pentagon's vast intelligence operations. He is been frequently mentioned as a candidate to replace retired Army Gen. David Petraeus as CIA director. \"Mike Vickers is an outstanding defense and intelligence professional and is well respected inside the Department of Defense and the intelligence community,\" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. It was unclear whether the Justice Department review could hurt Vickers' chances of being nominated to the CIA post. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the matter. \"When it comes to even the slightest hint that there may have been an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, there is actually little choice but to contact Justice,\" a senior defense official said. \"That does not mean they will do anything with it. This is a routine practice.\" The Pentagon inspector general's office is continuing to examine whether there were any other leaks of restricted information to the makers of the film. In a December 4 letter denying a McClatchy Freedom of Information Act request for the findings, the office said the material was \"currently part of an open investigation.\" A spokeswoman said Monday that the report \"has not yet been finalized and issued.\" Even though the inquiry was launched at the request of Rep. Peter King, R-NY, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, the Defense Department Inspector General's Office had not informed King or any other lawmaker of its findings by midday Monday, a politically risky decision that could ignite charges that officials were trying to protect President Barack Obama during his tough re-election battle. King told McClatchy that the delay in notifying him \"raises the question\" of whether officials were trying to put it off for political reasons, but he wanted to see the full report before drawing any conclusions. \"I am not looking for anyone to be indicted,\" he said. \"But the IG does not make referrals to the Justice Department as a matter of routine. To me the fact that any information at all would be given to Hollywood producers by this administration is disgraceful.\" \"If it is wrong enough or questionable enough for the IG to refer it to the Justice Department, that means it should not have been done.\" The film, by director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, originally was set for release just weeks before the November 6 election. But it was delayed amid Republican complaints that it could bring Obama votes by glorifying the bin Laden operation. The premier was held last week and the film is due for a limited public release on Wednesday. The senior defense official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, wrote in an email that Pentagon officials do not think the case \"will amount to anything.\" He pointed out that the Pentagon deemed as \"unclassified\" a transcript of a July 15, 2011, conversation among Vickers, Bigelow and Boal in which Vickers identified the YOU.S. special forces planner by name as someone who could be made available to brief the filmmakers. The transcript was released to Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog organization, in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The investigators found no evidence that White House officials were involved in any leaks of classified materials to the filmmakers, according to YOU.S. officials familiar with the findings. They reached that conclusion, however, without interviewing any White House officials or Panetta, who was the CIA director at the time of the bin Laden raid. Panetta reassured Congress in June before the investigators reached their findings that no classified information had been released to the filmmakers. A second YOU.S. official blamed bureaucratic handwringing for the delay in notifying King, not an orchestrated effort to protect the White House. \"This does not appear to be a cover-up or a wag-the-dog media stunt,\" the YOU.S. official said. \"Rather, this is about who gets to break the law and leak information for their own benefit.\" EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE The case is emblematic of an ongoing debate over what information the government deems to be secret, who can disclose classified material and to what degree leaks of such information jeopardize national security. Obama's Justice Department has prosecuted a record number of YOU.S. officials for leaking secret information to the news media that critics contend should not have been classified or did no harm to national security. The most prominent case involves the ongoing prosecution of Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who is accused of providing thousands of secret and confidential diplomatic and military documents to WikiLeaks, the online whistle-blowing organization. In a December 6 report, a presidential advisory panel that studied the classification issue found that \"the current classification system is fraught with problems. In its mission to support national security, it keeps too many secrets, and keeps them too long; it is overly complex; it obstructs desirable information sharing inside of government and with the public.\" \"A culture persists that defaults to the avoidance of risk rather than its proper management,\" the Public Interest Declassification Board said in recommending an extensive overhaul of the system. Steven Aftergood, who runs the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, said the release of the YOU.S. special forces planner's identity \"would most likely be considered sensitive, not for national security reasons, but for personal security reasons. If his name became public, it might raise security considerations for him as an individual.\" \"The boundaries of what is and what is not classified are soft and changeable. In the abstract, this person's identity might be sensitive but unclassified,\" he continued. \"It is very hard to say categorically that such information either would not or would be classified.\" King requested the investigation in August 2011 over concerns that classified information may have been given to the makers of the bin Laden movie that might have compromised tactics used by YOU.S. special forces and the methods used by the CIA to gather intelligence. Bigelow has said that \"to the best of our knowledge\" she and Boal did not receive classified information. \"We never requested classified information or was I aware that classified information was coming my way,\" she said in an interview with CBS earlier this month. Among its other conclusions, the Pentagon investigators determined that White House and Pentagon officials discussed allowing the filmmakers to interview Vickers. They also found that the meeting with the special operations planner never took place, and that no secret special operations tactics and techniques were revealed to the pair. One of the filmmakers attended a June 2011 CIA award ceremony that recognized the Navy SEALs and CIA officers involved in the raid, but no effort was made to protect the special operators' identities, investigators found. The investigation will create more controversy for the movie, which had its premiere December 10 in Los Angeles to widespread acclaim. Human right groups and other critics are complaining that scenes of the CIA's brutal interrogation of al Qaida detainees erroneously imply that torture provided crucial intelligence that led the agency to bin Laden's hiding place in Abbottabad, Pakistan. King requested the investigation in letters to the Pentagon and CIA inspectors general in which he cited a New York Times report that Bigelow and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. were given \"top-level access to the most classified mission in history.\" He also noted Bigelow's reported attendance at the CIA ceremony. King asked the inspectors general to examine whether there had been any consultations between White House, Defense Department and CIA officials on providing the filmmakers access to SEAL team members or undercover CIA officers. He also requested that they look at whether any secret techniques or tactics of the SEALs or the CIA had been compromised and whether leaks about details of the raid to the news media had hurt the CIA's intelligence collection methods or human sources. The Pentagon Inspector General's Office informed King in December 2011 that it was launching a formal investigation \"into actions taken by Defense Department personnel related to the release of information to the filmmakers.\" The CIA Inspector General's Office apparently declined to investigate, telling King in a November 8, 2011, letter that the agency's Office of Public Affairs was developing a written policy \"that will govern future interactions with the entertainment industry.\" In a May 23 letter, King wrote to Vickers that documents obtained by Judicial Watch in its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit \"raise serious questions regarding your central role in providing classified and sensitive information to individuals without appropriate security clearances.\" The documents included emails and the transcript of the conversation that Vickers had with Bigelow and Boal in which Vickers disclosed the name of the YOU.S. Special Operations Command planner. In a separate letter the same day, King expressed concerns to CIA Deputy Director Michael J. Morell about his role in the case. Morell became the acting agency chief after Petraeus resigned last month, and his name is among those mentioned as a top contender to replace Petraeus. In his letter to Morell, King said the Judicial Watch documents showed that the CIA had given Bigelow and Boal permission to visit at least six CIA facilities. They included secure vaults at the National Counterterrorism Center and possibly \"a sensitive, covered facility\" outside the CIA headquarters campus in Langley, Va., King wrote. The issue provided fodder during Obama's election battle against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, with a group of politically conservative former special forces officers producing a video in which they accused the president of taking too much credit for bin Laden's death and allowing too many leaks of secret information about the hunt. email: mtaylormcclatchydc.com, jlandaymcclatchydc.com 12-17-12 ja-ba AMX-2012-12-17T18:56:00-05:00 <doc_sep> Sources tell ABC News that the Inspector General for the Department of Defense has been preparing a report in which Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers is criticized for giving sensitive information to the filmmakers behind Zero Dark Thirty.\" Specifically, Vickers is said to have disclosed to the filmmakers the identity of a member of SEAL Team Six though not a member of the team that conducted the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. Names of members of that team are not to be disclosed because of the potential for violent retaliation. Some in the Pentagon think the Inspector General is holding the report until after the current Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, retires so as to not sully or embarrass him. A senior defense official disputed that. \"It is wrong for anyone to suggest the investigation has been held up for political reasons or to avoid embarrassment,\" the official said. \"The investigation simply has not concluded. These things often take time.\" The official added that Pentagon officials \"really do not think this will amount to anything.\" Documents released in May, after the conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained them through the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that in a July 14, 2011 meeting, Vickers told the filmmakers he would provide them with the name of a \"planner, SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander.\" \"The only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant because he should not be talking out of school.\" Vickers said. \"This at least, this gives him one step removed and he knows what he can and cannot say, but this way at least he can be as open as he can with you and it ought to meet your needs.\" The senior defense official said that Vickers was asked by the Pentagon to talk to \"the 'Zero Dark Thirty' filmmakers and others in the entertainment industry to provide unclassified information on the bin Laden operation. He was not doing this on his own. It is appropriate for department officials to work with the entertainment industry to try to inform how stories are told especially those associated with one of the greatest intelligence and military successes of a generation.\" The official said that \"Vickers is one of America's top defense and intelligence professionals who has closely guarded secrets for decades, and is highly respected in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community.\" -Jake Tapper",

    "document": "With a metallic clatter, evidence of an elaborate scheme to enrich a few landed in the receiving room of Richard Walker's surgical supply firm in South Africa. Although the true extent of the caper remains buried in the necks and backs of people scattered around the YOU.S., it began to unravel that day in 2009. Ortho Sol makes precision screws for the most delicate of construction projects: spinal fusion. Doctors around the world drive them into the vertebrae of patients with devastating back injuries. The company had repossessed some of its screws after one YOU.S. distributor Spinal Solutions LLC stopped paying its bills. But now, nestled with the returns, the brighter yellow luster of a few screws caught Walker's eye. Testing confirmed his fears. Some were not made of his firm's medical-grade titanium. Their uneven threads showed potential for backing out or breaking, he said. He feared the laser-etched markings intended to make them look authentic could be toxic to patients. Walker's conclusion: The Southern California firm was knocking off his products. The screw in the foreground is a knockoff of South Korean company YOU I Corp.'s product. The real screw, with its italic logo, is in the background. Credit: Michael I Schiller CIR Yet it would be two more years before an employee of Spinal Solutions alerted the YOU.S. Food and Drug Administration to the counterfeiting, and even then, the agency did not shut down the company. By the time Spinal Solutions went broke in 2013, the company had sold millions of dollars in implants to a nationwide network of surgeons, The Center for Investigative Reporting has found. Now patients are left with more questions than answers. The Gist Spinal Solutions, a company that distributed medical hardware to surgeons, is accused of counterfeiting its suppliers' medical implants. One Spinal Solutions insider said the company mixed authentic and counterfeit screws in surgical kits that were sent to doctors across the nation. The company wooed doctors as customers with private plane trips, lucrative consulting deals and cash. The FDA was alerted about alleged counterfeit operations in 2011, but the company did not close until 2013 and then because of crippling debt. \"What do they do if they find out there are these bogus parts that can come unscrewed?\" said Susan Reynolds, a Riverside County, California, woman whose doctor used Spinal Solutions screws on her in 2009, following years of intractable pain. \"I am a walking time bomb.\" The man at the center of the scandal is a company president who indulged in luxury private planes, strip club spending sprees, courtside seats at L.A. Lakers games as the company collapsed into debt. Attorneys lined up to serve him with legal documents now say they cannot find him. The company sold its wares to doctors who received consulting deals from Spinal Solutions worth thousands per month, rides on company planes, even bundles of 100 bills, company insiders allege. In turn, the physicians ordered the company's implants for their surgeries at hospitals in California, Nevada, Texas, Wisconsin and Maryland. Surgeons insist they never used subpar implants, and CIR has no evidence the doctors were involved in the scheme. But one former company insider says knockoff screws were mixed in with real ones. An elderly machinist finds himself unexpectedly wrapped up in the scandal. In an interview with CIR, he admitted to making scores of copies of surgical screws for Spinal Solutions. The company bargained him down to 65 a screw less than half of what they usually cost. The screws, real or fake, all funneled into what lawsuits claim was a larger scheme to bilk California's workers' compensation system, an employer-funded program designed to help those injured on the job. Some hospitals billed insurance carriers as much as 12,500 a screw before a 2012 change in state law shut down the astronomical markups. From that, Spinal Solutions stood to reap several thousand dollars from the sale of a single screw. Patients, though, may end up paying the steepest price. Derika Moses, a former softball star, lost her job, and then her home, as she grappled with pain and illness after her spinal surgery. Credit: Annie Tritt for CIR Patient's hardware raises questions Derika Moses hefted a case of 2-liter soda bottles while setting up a grocery store display in 2007. Her back popped, leaving the former softball star frozen in excruciating pain. Nothing helped. In desperation, Moses opted for spinal fusion surgery. The procedure offered little relief: Chronic pain and infections plagued her. Five years later, she had most of her spinal hardware removed, convinced that the erector set of metal in her spine was the source of ongoing problems. She begged hospital staff to let her keep the rods and screws. She hoped to fashion them into a necklace, she said, as a symbol of the pain she had endured. A nurse slipped them under her pillow. Moses, 38, of Riverside, had all but forgotten the bag of hardware until she received a letter from an Oakland, California, law firm in March. It suggested she might be the victim of medical fraud. \"I had to know if I was part of it,\" Moses said. \"I had to know.\" Attorneys contacted Moses after finding her name among Spinal Solutions' sales records. The law firm, Knox Ricksen, is working with other firms to file lawsuits more than 30 and counting on behalf of Moses and other patients. The lawyers accuse Spinal Solutions of selling counterfeit implants and doctors of accepting kickbacks in return for using them. During spinal fusion surgery, doctors implant screws into the vertebrae of patients with devastating back injuries. Credit: Praisaeng Shutterstock During spinal fusion surgery, doctors implant screws into the vertebrae of patients with devastating back injuries. Spinal screws are not Home Depot fare. The implants must fit together precisely to support a body in motion, said UCLA neurosurgeon Dr. Duncan McBride. \"It is like building a bridge in the back of someone is spine. So if you have inferior material, it is not going to work as well,\" he said. \"It is going to be less successful and potentially harmful.\" CIR showed photos of Moses' hardware to YOU I Corp., the South Korean company whose logo was etched on it. Company engineers noted the finishes and lot numbers on some of Moses' screws and connectors did not match their product. But the dead giveaway was the logo, they said, which lacks the firm's signature forward-leaning font. During an interview at the company's YOU.S. office in Orange County, California, General Manager Sung Hwang identified three of Moses' four screws as fakes. \"This is obviously not what we did,\" Hwang said. \"I feel sorry because patients got the surgery with improper devices, so they might suffer from it.\" Hwang said the company first heard about Spinal Solutions' counterfeiting from plaintiffs' attorneys in 2012 and is not happy about the matter. Moses' initial reaction on hearing about the apparent scam was fear because a few metal pieces remain in her back. But she says her feelings changed as she learned more from her attorneys about kickbacks that Spinal Solutions is accused of paying to doctors. \"It always, always turns to anger,\" she said, \"every time I sit and think about what they did.\" Moses lost her job, and then her home, as she grappled with pain and illness after her spinal surgery. The flashy businessman who sold her implants, meanwhile, lived a life of luxury. The IRS determined that Roger Williams and his wife, Mary, underpaid their taxes by a combined half a million dollars due to fraud in 2009 and 2010, according to court filings. Credit: The Press-Enterprise The IRS determined that Roger Williams and his wife, Mary, underpaid their taxes by a combined half a million dollars due to fraud in 2009 and 2010, according to court filings. An executive's lavish lifestyle One private plane was not enough for the Spinal Solutions founder. Roger Williams had three. Williams spent 16 years in the orthopedic sales business with his father before he went out on his own. He started Spinal Solutions in 1999 and launched a firm selling knee and hip implants three years later. From nothing, he built an 18 million-a-year business based in Murrieta, California. By 2008, his planes were shuttling staff and surgical equipment from coast to coast. He also followed the Los Angeles Lakers all over the country. He ordered his seven-seat jet painted with stripes of Lakers purple and gold, and he and his wife sat courtside among celebrities, according to interviews with former employees. Sometimes he invited a member of the team onboard. \"He lived like the richest guy on earth. Like a movie star or something,\" said Andreas Leuthold, a pilot who worked for Williams. Williams and his wife had a BMW, a Mercedes-Benz, a yacht named \"Spare Change\" and a 6,300-square-foot Murrieta home, according to court records and interviews. He withdrew thousands of dollars from Spinal Solutions' account to patronize strip clubs like the Spearmint Rhino Gentlemen's Club. When creditors later asked why, he said, according to court transcripts, \"Because I felt like it.\" But Spinal Solutions also racked up big debts with hardware manufacturers and then refused to pay, according to industry executives and lawsuits. The company increasingly relied on Lenders Funding LLC, a firm that fronted cash at an interest rate of 35 percent. By 2013, the company owed the lender about 35,000 per month solely in interest payments and imploded in debt. It remains unclear when Spinal Solutions began to counterfeit surgical implants. And it is nearly impossible to trace each knockoff to each patient or to confirm how many were affected. In a line of business built on meticulous order, the inner workings of Spinal Solutions were a study in disorder. Take Operations Manager Jeff Fields, whom Williams called \"my main guy.\" Fields was in charge of the company's inventory of surgical implants. A court declaration from Williams' brother-in-law says that Fields' work was \"sloppy\" and that he would seen him use methamphetamines on the job. Fields did not respond to letters and Facebook messages. When reached by phone, he said, \"I have got no interest in speaking to anybody,\" and hung up. The brother-in-law, Carl Sisler, was Spinal Solutions' first employee and knows more about the company than anyone else, Williams said in a court filing. Sisler is described as a \"Medical Surgical instrument technician\" in his own court declaration. But Sisler denied being an instrument technician and told CIR he was in prison for domestic violence for many years of the company's run. Sisler's convictions also included making a terrorist threat and indecent exposure, but he was paroled in 2008, according to prison records. \"I was a nobody there,\" Sisler insisted in a telephone interview, during which he slurred his words and acknowledged he was drunk. \"I was the gofer guy who made 285 a week cleaning toilets.\" Williams, meanwhile, accused his bookkeeper of sabotage and embezzlement in a court declaration and said the books never were made right. Williams had an especially volatile relationship with his wife, Mary, whom he once described as the company's chief financial officer. He was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence in 2013. The IRS determined the Williamses underpaid their taxes by a combined half a million dollars due to fraud in 2009 and 2010, according to court filings. The couple's taxable income topped 5 million each year. Mary Williams filed an appeal to the IRS in tax court last year, blaming her \"controlling, abusive\" husband for the problem. She referred CIR to her attorney, who declined to comment. The company's records got caught in the crossfire. In a deposition related to creditors, she described getting law enforcement to open the Spinal Solutions offices so she could take hard drives. \"Half of the stuff is gone because my wife took it, you know,\" Roger Williams said during a bankruptcy-related hearing. Pilot Bob Garrison, who used to work for Spinal Solutions, recalls handing off packages of cash to doctors on two occasions. Credit: Will Evans CIR Pilot Bob Garrison, who used to work for Spinal Solutions, recalls handing off packages of cash to doctors on two occasions. Flying screws, doctors and cash Spinal Solutions could not have raked in millions or spread its products across the YOU.S. if not for doctors eager to do business. Roger Williams lured them with private plane rides, generous consulting contracts and even cash, interviews and records show. Williams did not respond to calls, emails or letters from CIR. Williams made it clear the consulting deals and free flights were tools to keep doctors hooked on his products, said Quin Rudin, a businessman who poured money into the company when it hit a cash crunch in 2012. \"He said that many times. 'In order to do business with these guys, I got to take care of them,' Rudin recalled from behind thick glass in a downtown Oakland jail, where he landed after pleading guilty in an unrelated fraud case. Pilot Bob Garrison enjoyed a bird's-eye view of the shenanigans, flying screws and doctors and cash. \"Roger told me 'These doctors are greedy. They are so greedy, you cannot believe it. All I do I take advantage of their greed,' Garrison told CIR. On one occasion, Garrison said Williams had him hand one out-of-state doctor an envelope stuffed with 20,000 in cash. On another, Garrison said he handed a doctor a bottle of wine in a canister packed with 100 bills. One Spinal Solutions sales representative said he suspected Williams was using perks to woo surgeons. \"He said that any doctor that I could bring on board would be taken care of,\" said Robert Ashcraft, who worked for Spinal Solutions in Nevada. Meanwhile, he said, Williams was pushing a product that was \"second-rate crap.\" One busy spinal surgeon, Dr. Cully White of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, took breaks from his suburban mansion on Spinal Solutions plane trips to the snowy resort town of Vail, Colorado, and the sunny Mexican beach retreat of Cabo San Lucas. The doctor's longtime sales representative, John Sargent, went along for the rides in 2007 and 2008. Sargent said they went skiing in Vail and fishing in Cabo but also talked business. He encouraged White to reimburse the company, he said, but does not know if White did. \"I was telling White for a long time that I did not think Williams was a very savory character,\" Sargent said. Williams sold hardware manufactured by a legitimate company, said Sargent, who took a 25 to 30 percent commission. But he did recall that Spinal Solutions once sent a set of implants without labels. \"When the set came in, I said there is no way I am bringing this into the hospital,\" Sargent said. \"It just did not look like what you know it is supposed to look like.\" In more than a dozen operative reports from 2010 and 2011, White noted that the screws he put into patients' backs came from Spinal Solutions, according to documents obtained by CIR. Sargent said he did not personally see most of the implants White used, but he had a \"spider sense\" that the doctor never implanted any bogus hardware. White's successful career faltered when he was hit with an unrelated federal indictment and medical board investigation last year. White amassed a 22 million fortune, then scammed insurance companies for a little more, prosecutors said. The doctor pleaded guilty to billing for nerve monitoring that did not happen and was sentenced in April to six months in prison and six months on house arrest. He did not respond to letters sent to his Minnesota prison. Wining, dining and flying surgeons used to be commonplace in the medical technology industry, said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia University. The practice has faded in recent years, he said, with government scrutiny, new transparency rules and growing awareness that gifts create a psychological obligation to give back. \"The company that takes you out to dinner is the company that you are going to favor one way or another,\" Rothman said. Dr. Randy Davis said he did not take any bags of cash or free vacations. The Baltimore-area spine surgeon did once accept a seat close to actor Jack Nicholson at a Lakers game with Roger Williams but told CIR, \"I cannot stand basketball that is the worst thing you could bribe me with.\" Davis said Williams was a fast-talking pitchman who persuaded him to sign up for Spinal Solutions' implants, which he estimated he used in several hundred surgeries, and for consulting agreements to develop new surgical tools and implants. He was paid 250,000 for one of the agreements, he said. The money did not affect Davis' use of the implants, he said. \"I really believe that I do not make decisions for patients based on money,\" he said. The counterfeiting claims do not ring true to him, either. He said he never received any substandard implants. After the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Williams used his planes to deliver needed medical supplies, and Davis traveled with him. The doctor believed Williams was doing good things, he said, and thought the ideas he offered as a Spinal Solutions consultant would help patients. But Davis said he grew frustrated by the lack of progress on his projects and eventually ended the five-year relationship in late 2012. Another consultant who used the company's implants, Dr. Paul McDonough of Texas, received at least nine 8,000 checks in 2012 from Spinal Solutions, according to court records. McDonough helped create an implant prototype, but in the end, \"nothing happened to it,\" Williams said in court testimony. McDonough did not respond to repeated phone calls and a list of questions faxed to his Abilene office. Consulting deals are common in the medical field and are legitimate if the physician provides a meaningful service for a reasonable compensation. But whistleblowers and prosecutors have gone after top device firms over phony agreements, claiming they amount to kickbacks. Williams' ability to connect with surgeons across the country meant that when counterfeit hardware slipped into the mix, the problem went national, according to one company insider. The former sales representative remembers watching another employee pluck a few screws from a tray in the company warehouse for shipping to an out-of-state surgery. The screws did not look like the other ones, said the sales rep, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. He grabbed a few to examine them. Some were blatantly inferior, he said, at times with metal shavings and burrs in the threads. \"And I saw these screws being shipped all over the United States,\" he said. South Korean medical hardware company YOU I Corp. once supplied screws to Spinal Solutions. Credit: Adithya Sambamurthy CIR South Korean medical hardware company YOU I Corp. once supplied screws to Spinal Solutions. Employee alerts FDA The sales rep grew increasingly disturbed thinking about patients waking up from surgery with what he described as garbage in their spines. \"To do that to somebody when they are already experiencing tremendous pain, then to take a counterfeit screw so your profit margins are more, especially a poorly crafted counterfeit screw. It was just so ridiculous,\" he said. The authorities would surely shut down the operation, he thought, if they only knew. After making numerous phone calls, the rep set up a meeting with the FDA in June 2011. He described how he spread out an array of questionable screws for FDA investigator DeJon Harris on a table at Coco's Bakery Restaurant in Corona, California. \"I also impressed upon her, you need to go sirens blazing and door-kicking and stop this,\" the sales rep said. \"Every day you guys do not do something, some loved one is getting these fucking screws put in their spine.\" The sales rep said he gave Harris screws to take back to the FDA district office in Ontario, California. \"You could not ignore that they were counterfeit,\" he said. \"It was so blatantly obvious to even the untrained eye.\" In cases of alleged counterfeiting, the FDA could bring in its Office of Criminal Investigations or call the FBI, spokesman Christopher Kelly said. The agency did not answer questions about whether either happened with Spinal Solutions, citing an ongoing investigation. Garrison, Spinal Solutions' private pilot, said he then reached out to the FDA at the sales rep's suggestion, telling investigators he delivered screws in plastic bags labeled with felt-tipped pens. \"Whether they were legal or not I do not know,\" Garrison said. The month after the meeting with the sales rep, Harris and another FDA investigator inspected Spinal Solutions' headquarters, FDA records show, and encountered a company in disarray. The firm was assembling kits with dozens of screws, rods and other components without any formal process or paperwork to indicate what went where, inspection records say. Required systems for setting aside flawed products and preventing mix-ups did not exist. Federal regulators sent Spinal Solutions a warning letter in early 2012, ordering the company to fix its quality control problems. The company pledged to make changes. Around that time, YOU I Corp., the South Korean medical hardware firm, alerted the FDA that it was hearing from plaintiffs' attorneys that Spinal Solutions was counterfeiting hardware. \"We just reported that these allegations are out there,\" said Brian Park, the company's New York attorney. \"Do something.\" But the FDA allowed Spinal Solutions to continue selling its products while the company tried to shape up, court filings show. If the agency found evidence of counterfeiting, it did not mention it in documents provided to CIR under the Freedom of Information Act. In spring 2013, Spinal Solutions recalled surgical equipment that was not properly labeled and some implants that did not match FDA-approved designs. Then, crippled by debt, it shut down. But by then, Spinal Solutions had profited from a 14-year run, and its hardware studded the backs of patients from Los Angeles to Baltimore. This counterfeit screw is based on YOU I Corp.'s product, a firm manager said. Credit: Adithya Sambamurthy CIR This counterfeit screw is based on YOU I Corp.'s product, a firm manager said. Machinist's involvement The source of the counterfeits, plaintiffs' attorneys allege, was 85-year-old machinist William Crowder. He owns a small office park machine shop in Southern California's Inland Empire. He had experience working on parts for boats, planes and, it appears, the human body. In an interview with CIR, Crowder said Spinal Solutions' operations manager, Jeff Fields, gave him professional-looking medical screws and asked for exact copies. \"He might want 50 of this size and 40 of these,\" said Crowder, who has been named as a defendant in dozens of lawsuits. Plaintiffs' attorneys believe that thousands of counterfeit screws went into unsuspecting patients, though Crowder testified in a recent deposition to making \"maybe 500.\" \"I wish I had been making thousands, but I did not,\" he told CIR. A few years ago, Crowder stopped making the screws because Spinal Solutions was unwilling to pay a fair price, he said. His doctor, he added, had been after him for years to quit work anyway. A consultant hired by Spinal Solutions to help the company meet FDA requirements also found that Crowder's machine shop did not qualify as a supplier, in part because his tools were not calibrated. Richard Walker, the South African executive who discovered forgeries of his golden screws back in 2009, had toured the machine shop years ago. He wanted to see whether it could repair tools used to implant his firm's hardware. Walker rejected the shop on appearance alone. \"It was not conducive to the manufacture or taking care of medical products,\" Walker told CIR. \"If I had a surgery that used a component from that workshop, I would be worried.\" There was some \"old stuff\" in his shop, Crowder acknowledged, but also modern equipment and a quality control system. His memory is faltering these days, Crowder said, but he recalled that a woman from the FDA spent two days in his shop a few years ago. He told CIR that she did not ask for samples of screws or talk about implants. \"No, she did not say nothing about that. No,\" he said. \"We got a clean bill of health from them.\" The FDA's website shows the inspector ended a review on July 30, 2012, and did not call for any changes. CIR filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the report, but the agency has failed to provide it or answer questions about the scope of the review. Crowder also said he did not etch anything on the screws he made for Spinal Solutions. Instead, that trail seems to lead to another Spinal Solutions contractor, Ryan Zavilenski. On his YouTube page, Zavilenski boasts of owning a laser engraver. He also posted photos of spinal implants on his photo-sharing website. From behind the screen door of his Santa Rosa, California, apartment, Zavilenski confirmed that he did laser engraving for Spinal Solutions several years ago. He said he engraved only a few screws, however, which he called prototypes. The photos Zavilenski posted online included implants with other company markings etched on them. He did not engrave those, he said, but instead photographed items he found at Spinal Solutions to demonstrate to potential customers the kind of work he could do. A few of the photos he posted included screws bearing the markings of YOU I, the South Korean company that once supplied Spinal Solutions. Company engineers examined those photos at the request of CIR and reported that none looked authentic. \"Font, logo, edge finish, surface finish everything is different from ours,\" said Sung Hwang, the general manager. Crowder said the screws in Zavilenski's photos looked similar to the ones he made, but not quite the same. The ones Crowder recalls making also were prototypes, he believed. Still, he said he would not be worried if they ended up in people's backs and necks. \"Why would I be worried?\" he said. \"If the engineer designed them wrong then that is his fault. It is not mine.\" Researcher Emily McKellar contributed to this story. It was edited by Amy Pyle and copy edited by Sheela Kamath and Nikki Frick.

Derika Moses, who said she has had 23 surgeries on her back since 2008, is one of the plaintiffs. \"This has been terrible, worst thing that is ever happened to me.not knowing if the stuff still in me they could not get out will one day kill me,\" Moses said outside of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on Grand Avenue on Friday afternoon. \"I was left in extreme physical and mental pain as well as left with permanent disabilities and disfigurements,\" she said. Several lawsuits filed across the state have also claimed the metal screws were produced in a Temecula machine shop, authorities have said. Within the lawsuit, the shop owner and several doctors are listed for taking kickbacks while hospitals profited from selling the fake screws, Kabateck said. According to attorneys, Spinal Solutions LLC is the company accused of distributing and inflating the cost of the screws. Michael Drobot, the former owner of Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, is accused of overseeing the scheme that included making cheap screws and distributing them to different hospitals, Kabateck explained. Drobot's attorney, Terree Bowers, disputes that claim. \"Michael Drobot and Pacific Hospital had absolutely nothing to do with allegations concerning the counterfeit screws,\" Bowers told KCAL9's Rachel Kim on Friday. Bowers said Drobot has admitted to giving kickbacks to physicians, but said all of those surgeries were medically needed and authorized by insurance companies. Right now the plaintiffs' attorneys say there may be thousands of other victims, and they want justice for those like Moses. \"Think about somebody other than yourself for once,\" Moses said Friday. \"All the people's lives you might have placed in danger.\"",
    "reference_summary": "Medical firm founder Roger Williams owned private planes, flashy cars, and a yacht dubbed \"Spare Change\"; he had courtside seats to see the Lakers and enjoyed spending thousands at strip clubs. But an investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting suggests his 18-million-a-year California company, Spinal Solutions, made its money in part through counterfeiting expensive screws used in spinal surgeries and then distributing the knockoff screws to surgeons. Williams allegedly wooed doctors via lavish vacations, Lakers seats, and containers full of cash. There is no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting, but plenty of them used the screws. A machinist, now 85, tells CIR that he made copies of screws for the company for 65 each, which is about half of their typical price-and far, far less than the 12,500 hospitals once billed for them. Other companies' logos were also falsified on the screws. A whistleblower finally told the FDA about the alleged counterfeiting in 2011, but the company was allowed to continue operation until debts ruined it in 2013. The losers in all this, of course, were the patients, who could face dangers thanks to the substandard equipment. \"This has been terrible, worst thing that is ever happened to me not knowing if the stuff still in me they could not get out will one day kill me,\" says one patient.

    "document": "NASA is asking everyday terrestrials to come up with cosmic solutions to a very down-to-earth problem: how to deal with human waste when you are trapped in a space suit for up to a week. The American space agency has launched a competition for participants to invent a hands-free system that routes and collects waste away from the astronaut's body for up to six days. Inventors have the chance of winning 30,000, and have until December 20 to submit their best \"space poop\" ideas. \"I can tell you that space flight is not always glamorous,\" said astronaut Rick Mastracchio, a veteran of Space Shuttle Soyuz, and Space Station missions speaking in a video promoting NASA's call to action. \"People need to go to the bathroom even in a spacecraft.\" During spaceflight astronauts can be in their suits for more than 10 hours at a time. But with NASA planning on sending humans deeper into space, future missions will require the advancement of new technology to keep the astronauts alive and well. Currently, crews wear an absorbent diaper but these would not be suitable for flights longer than a day, according to a description on the contest's website HeroX. While it goes without saying that nobody in their right mind would want to wear a diaper for a week, the issue is more than a matter of squeamishness, it is a matter of life or death. Mastracchio said it is vital that the waste needs to be treated otherwise it could harm or even kill the astronaut. \"Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in. This is the problem we are asking you to help us with.\" NASA said it aims to test the winning ideas in the next year and roll out successful systems in the next three. <doc_sep> NASA vowed to award up to three 30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems When you have got to go, but you are out there in space, zipped up in a spacesuit, with no toilet in sight and a crew of other astronauts around, what do you do? NASA has launched a contest for inventors to solve this uncomfortable issue, and promises to award 30,000 to the best \"space poop\" solutions. Inventors have until December 20 to submit designs for a personalized waste-wicking system that will handle everything, hands-free, for a period of up to six days. \"The old standby solution consisted of diapers,\" said the description of contest details at www.herox.com SpacePoop. \"However, the diaper is only a very temporary solution, and does not provide a healthy protective option longer than one day.\" Sometimes, astronauts have to wait even longer. The two men and one woman who packed themselves into a Russian Soyuz space capsule last week had to wait two full days between launching from Kazakhstan and arriving at the International Space Station. The Soyuz is equipped with a portable toilet, which looks like an air-powered pee jug. On future missions to deep space destinations like an asteroid or Mars, NASA suspects it could take up to 144 hours, or six days, to get to a proper toilet. In emergency situations, astronauts may need to zip themselves into a fully pressurized, bulky orange spacesuit, complete with helmet and gloves. \"While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose,\" NASA said. That is where the inventors come in. Astronauts need some way to clear away urine, fecal matter and menstrual blood efficiently, or they risk infection. The problem is that in weightlessness, fluids can blob up and stick to surfaces, while solids float in the air. \"You do not want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,\" NASA said, recalling how easy babies can get diaper rash. Currently, while at the International Space Station, astronauts use a toilet contraption that includes a vacuum and a tube to help evacuate fecal matter. To urinate, they use a funnel attached to a hose that can be adapted for a sitting or standing position, and uses air to move urine away. NASA vowed to award up to three 30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems. The goal is to test them within a year and fully implement them within three years. NASA says the first human missions to Mars could take place by the 2030s.

Because of the Space Poop Challenge, that is why. It is a 30,000 incentive prize for a NASA-worthy system for spacesuits that routes human waste away from the body, hands-free. It could be the difference between life and death for astronauts in emergency situations that require extended like days periods of time spent contained to their spacesuit. Check out the challenge guidelines to learn more about the details of this challenge, and read on for some interesting factoids about dealing with bodily functions in space. Space is an extreme and unsafe environment even before you consider the issue of, um, using the bathroom. But that is just it we have to consider that issue. So before you go running off to make space travel history by drumming up new solutions, let us talk about the current situation in space. There are two space-age toilets on the ISS, located in the Tranquility and Zvezda modules. The second commode was put in just a few years ago, after the first unit was having some problems. Effectively managing human waste is critical for the health and safety of astronauts in space. Our terrestrial toilets use gravity to flush everything away, but doing your business in the weightlessness of outer space gets tricky. So, how exactly does one go number one, or number two, in space? The Amazing Zero-G John The toilets on the ISS are so different from yours, astronauts actually need some supplemental potty training to figure them out. And they are astronauts. Without getting into the nitty-gritty, let us just say that relieving oneself in space these days is a lot better than it used to be. Today, going to the restroom in zero-g is a quick process, but it looks more complicated than using a car. Luckily, they get to practice on training toilets before blastoff pun intended There seem to be a lot of steps involved, so you probably do not want to be in a hurry. Liquid and solid waste are handled differently: there is a somewhat normal-looking toilet seat, along with what is known as a \"urine hose.\" The hole in the toilet seat is smaller than usual, so apparently, it can be a bit tough to get the alignment right at first. Women and men are equal here when it comes to number two, using the same setup, but urinating requires different attachments. Space toilets use suction instead of gravity, for both urine and solid waste. You do not really sit in space, because you do not weight anything, so astronauts need to either strap themselves in or use handles to hold themselves down. You can actually check out a guided tour of the toilet cabin on the ISS, given by Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti: Out of Sight, Out of Mind? On Earth, we get to flush our waste away and never see it again unless something goes horribly wrong But on the ISS, it is not that simple. Urine and solid waste are collected and dealt with separately. Urine and other waste water goes through a very advanced filtration and purification process, before it ends up being used again for you guessed it drinking water. In case you needed more proof, the space program really is not for the faint of heart. Think you could swing it? Before you answer, you should also know that the water they end up drinking is actually purer than the water most of us drink on a daily basis. I guess that is worth the view. Solid waste ends up getting packed up, compressed and sent off to burn up in the atmosphere like a shooting star. Make a wish! Astronauts try to take care of all their business on the space station, rather than in their spacesuits. But when nature calls on a spacewalk, they have to use the equivalent of an adult diaper for space travelers. Wearing a diaper is a reasonable solution for short term waste management for launch, reentry, and spacewalks, but future long distance missions might require astronauts to remain in a protective suit for up to 6 days. That is a long time no matter how you slice it, and a diaper is simply not a safe or sustainable waste management tool. NASA is working on this challenge themselves, but as we prepare our species for interplanetary travel, they could use some help from the crowd with these kinds of details! The Space Poop Challenge As hard as it is for astronauts to use the toilet in the pressurized environments like ISS, it is an even bigger challenge when you have to wear a spacesuit particularly if you have to wear it for more than a few hours This is why the Space Poop Challenge is offering up to 30,000 for the best ideas to create a system that will collect waste and route it away from an astronaut's body, hands-free, while wearing a spacesuit. Check out the Space Poop Challenge page to learn more, get registered, and take your place in the annals of space travel history! <doc_sep> NASA has initiated a \"Space Poop Challenge,\" and is calling on innovators to come up with new designs for a spacesuit waste management system. Sometimes the \"call of nature\" is really urgent and if you are in a spacesuit, you cannot easily rush to the bathroom. That is why NASA has created the \"Space Poop Challenge.\" The agency is asking innovators to create fecal, urine and menstrual management systems for spacesuits, that would work for up to six days. Up to 30,000 in prize money is up for grabs. NASA astronauts wear diapers to take care of their bodily needs while they are launching, landing or spacewalking. However, these diapers are only good for a few hours; sitting in poop, urine or menstrual fluid for more than that is bad for your health, and your backside, besides. How to Pee in Space and What to Do If the Toilet Breaks \"Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member,\" NASA wrote in a statement on HeroX, a website where people or organizations can host incentive-based competitions. \"In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration: 144 hours,\" according to the statement. \"The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member's safety, the solution proposed system needs to take no more than five minutes to set up and integrate with the spacesuit Further complicating the challenge is the requirement that the system work in microgravity, in a pressurized spacesuit. This means would-be designers need to contend with floating water and debris that everybody really, really wants to keep far away from human orifices or vital spacesuit systems. The new system will be designed for NASA's Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit, an improvement on the orange spacesuit used for shuttle launches and landings. That suit is expected to be used by astronauts on the Orion spacecraft. The submission deadline for the Space Poop Challenge is December 20, and winners will be announced January 31, 2017.

We are also on Facebook and Google Original article on Space.com. <doc_sep> Published on May 8, 2015 ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti shows how to use the most unglamorous but often asked-about part of living on the International Space Station: the toilet. A fan creates suction to avoid smells and floating waste. Solid waste is stored and put in cargo ferries to burn up when the spacecraft leaves the Space Station. The astronaut urine is recycled into drinking water. Follow Samantha via http: samanthacristoforetti.esa.int <doc_sep> Challenge Overview The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA seeks proposed solutions for urine, fecal and menstrual management systems to be used in the crew's launch and entry suits over a continuous duration of up to 144 hours. An in-suit waste management system would be beneficial for contingency scenarios or for any long duration tasks. Waste management systems should address fecal, urine, and or menstrual waste management in a pressurized survival suit environment for six days while protecting the safety and health of crew members. Solutions should provide for urine collection of up to 1L per day per crew member, for a total of 6 days. Fecal collection rates should be targeted for 75 grams of fecal mass and 75 mL fecal volume per crewmember per day for a total of 6 days duration. Menstrual collection systems should handle up to 80 mL over 6 days. NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. NASA will consider collaborating with winners and or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. Background Spaceflight launch and entry suits are worn for launch and entry activities to protect the crew from any off-nominal events. Up until now, a crew member could be in their launch and entry suit for more than 10 hours at a time leading up to either a launch or landing scenario, and former astronauts have worn diapers in case they need to relieve themselves. The diaper is only used temporarily until the crew has successfully launched from or returned to Earth. It is eventually removed along with the launch and entry suit. Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member. In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration 144-hour The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member's safety, the Solution needs to take no more than 5 minutes of that time. The crew member will remain in their suit at a pressure of 4.3 PSID and in 100 oxygen environment, with a few tasks to complete inside the depressurized vehicle prior to vehicle. A system to route and collect human waste away from the body without the use of hands, that operates in the prescribed environment, is being sought to keep astronauts alive and healthy over 144 hours. Current commercial products that provide urine waste management utilize gravity to route and collect urine away from the body. Some require the use of hands, and most are not meant to be used for 144 hours. No commercial products have been found that provide fecal waste management for a 144-hour period with or without the use of hands. While the implemented Solution can be discarded after each mission, it does have to function well for 6 days and multiple bowel and bladder evacuations. ABOUT POOPING IN SPACE. This challenge does not require you to be working in a field involving microgravity or to fully understand how the body and fluids work in a microgravity environment. We are going to tell you a bit about what 's different. First, microgravity is what you might call \"Zero Gravity\". Think vacuum. In a vacuum, solids, liquids and gases do not act the way they do on earth, where they are influenced by earth's gravity. You probably have no problem imagining things floating around in space. Yes, sometimes solids, liquids, and gases do this. But they also might cling to the nearest surface due to surface tension. Imagine taking a shower up in space and having a glob of water under your armpit. Also, on earth, solids and liquids would likely mix together at least a little when in contact. Maybe not in microgravity. As for your bodily functions. Well, in space there is no gravity to direct your urine away from your body when you release it. Same for poop. There is no gravity to pull it away when you release it. Menstrual fluid? At least some of it will exit a woman's body. You do not want that traveling around your suit. And do not forget, you cannot always count on poop being solid, especially if you are up in space and nervous about the fact that your vehicle cabin has depressurized. You do not want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for 6 days. If you have ever taken care of a baby, you know how easy it is to get diaper rash. Left untreated, that can turn into a dangerous infection. You do not want fecal matter getting into the urethra or the vagina, causing urinary tract or vaginal infections. Of course, you do not want them to migrate to mouth, nose, ears or cuts. The point? Your Solution has to keep all of these materials away from the body, its orifices, and the spacesuit air inlet outlet orifices. How has NASA handled this in the past? Well, for one thing, they were not handling it for 6 days. Maybe a few hours. In the recent past, astronauts have worn an extremely absorbent adult diaper. Most of the time the diaper is there for emergencies. Prior to that, men wore Urine Collection and Transfer Assembly UCTA and Fecal Collection Systems FCS Women have never had anything besides the adult diaper while wearing a suit. When not wearing a suit, but within the vehicle, women had a choice of 3 versions of cup-type urine collection systems that used air flow to effectively because urine to swirl away from a woman's body. No matter how you look at it, getting rid of wastes has been complicated, crude, uncomfortable, and messy, even with the use of hands. And now we are saying that you do not have use of your hands at least not inside the suit next to your body. ABOUT THE SPACE SUIT You will design a solution that can be incorporated into the orange Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit MACES MACES has been adapted for missions of longer duration than the original Advanced Crew Escape Suit ACES was designed for. The whole suit, including the gloves, is pressurized to 4.3 PSID to enable the body to function properly. Without pressure the body swells, loses most of its circulation, and of course, causes extreme pain. The gloves are attached by metal bearings to the sleeves to ensure a proper seal. Once the suit is sealed, it must remain sealed until the astronaut enters another pressurized environment. While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose. Gas 100 oxygen enters at 4.5 cubic feet per minute through a waist level connector to fill the 2\" space between the astronaut's body and the suit, and circulates out through another waist level connector to be cleaned and brought back to the suit. A mesh cover protects against particles getting into the air connectors. If they did get inside, they could easily block the flow of air. This gas supply is clearly a very precious commodity. While a very small amount is lost to leakage, the Solution must not add to this leakage. However, careful use of 1000 cubic centimeters per minute 0.01 cubic feet per minute over a period of 3 minutes per use would not jeopardize the integrity of the suit. The suit allows the astronauts to move around, get into tight spaces, and sit down and buckle up for long periods of time. Your Solution should be comfortable in all of these situations. Finally, a small power sources of up to 28V with current below 100mA could be provided inside or outside of the suit.

PLANS FOR THE WINNING SOLUTIONS NASA is ideally looking for Solutions that are comprised of technologies at a minimum Technical Readiness Level TRL of level 4, such that the Solution can be tested within 1 year and fully implemented within 3 years. However, for breakthrough innovations, NASA will consider Solutions that are at a lower TRL and therefore a longer implementation timeline. NASA will consider collaborating with winners and or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. Prizes The challenge offers up to 30,000 USD in prizes to innovative solutions for long duration waste management in a microgravity environment. NASA will award up to three prizes for the best ideas. NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. How do I win? To be eligible for an award, the solution must, at minimum: Keep urine and or fecal waste away from a crew member's body for a minimum of 144 hours while in a space suit Operate in a microgravity scenario Operate within a full launch and entry suit at an internal pressure of 4.3 PSID and 100 oxygen environment which cannot be opened for manual access within the 144 hour time period Operate while a crew member is moving, bending, and or seated and strapped into a chair Manage at least one of the three following human wastes for up to 6 days Manage up to 1L per day of urine per crew member based on planned liquid intake during mission Manage up to 75 grams of fecal mass and 75mL fecal volume per crew member based on planned food intake during mission Fecal matter may range from liquid to solid, but the Solution is not required to handle uncontrollable, ongoing diarrhea. Manage up to 80 mL of menstrual fluid over 6 days Require less than five minutes for a crew member to, on their own, set up and secure the Solution to their body, prior to, or along with, getting into their launch and entry suit.

See, while the International Space Station has a pretty fancy toilet, an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking. But as NASA looks toward future missions in deep space, it is also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days, reports Time. That is where you come in. The agency is offering a 30,000 prize in a \"space poop challenge\" if someone can create \"a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands.\" There are plenty of stipulations. For example, the system \"needs to take no more than five minutes to set up as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com. While such a challenge might seem humorous, a solution \"could be the difference between life and death,\" notes the contest website. \"You do not want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,\" NASA adds in a release. \"Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in,\" says astronaut Rick Mastracchio in a video. Inventors have until December 20 to submit their entries. NASA plans to test the top entries next year, with a solution executed within three years. A scientist thinks humans could get to Mars in a month.",

    "document": "Lincoln University students will now have to endure a physical exam determining each student's BMI body mass index before they are permitted to graduate. An individual's BMI measures the amount of body fat.Amid fierce criticisms, Lincoln University has recently installed a new requirement for its undergraduate students. If your BMI is over 30, you are required to take a physical education class.This new requirement has caused an uproar from some students and professors who argue that the university is actively discriminating against those who are obese. Some students argue that their time at Lincoln may be prolonged because of an additional class.University officials say that they are actively working to increase the health of their students, but many have their doubts.\"What is the point of this? What does my BMI have to do with my academic overcome?\" asked Dionard Henderson, a freshman. \"Some students on campus are just confused why a certain BMI has to be a requirement. Are there not a sufficient amount of prerequisites to complete prior to graduating from college?Dr. James L. DeBoy, who is Chair and Professor of the Department of Health, Physical Education and Recreation could not be reached for comment.Sophomore Lousie Kaddie disagrees with the requirement.\"It is not up to Lincoln to tell me how much my BMI should be. I came here to get a degree and that is what the administration should be concerned with,\" she added <doc_sep> More than two dozen seniors at Lincoln University, in Oxford, Pa., are in danger of not being able to graduate this spring not because they are under disciplinary probation or have not fulfilled the requirements of their majors, but because they were obese as freshmen. All had body mass index BMI scores above 30 the YOU.S. Department of Health and Human Services' threshold for obesity when they arrived on campus in the fall of 2006, but none have taken college-sanctioned steps to show they have lost weight or at least tried. They are in the historically black university's first graduating class required to either have a BMI below 30 or to take \"Fitness for Life,\" a one semester class that mixes exercise, nutritional instruction and discussion of the risks of obesity. It might sound like a joke, or a violation of individual rights, but James L. DeBoy, chair of Lincoln's health, physical education and recreation department, said he sees it as his \"professional responsibility to be honest and tell students they are not healthy.\" Ninety-two students, 19 percent of the freshman class of 484 that entered three years ago, had BMIs of 30 or greater. While most of those students took the class or demonstrated to DeBoy's department that they had lost weight, about 25 have neither proven they have lost weight nor signed up for the class. DeBoy began notifying the students about their unfulfilled requirement earlier this month, spurring an article Wednesday in The Lincolnian, the university's weekly student newspaper. Students interviewed for the story seemed upset by the requirement and, perhaps, a bit blindsided by it. \"It is not up to Lincoln to tell me how much my BMI should be. I came here to get a degree and that is what the administration should be concerned with,\" said Lousie Kaddie, a sophomore. DeBoy said it is exactly what the university should be concerned with. \"This country's in the midst of an obesity epidemic and African-Americans are hit hard by obesity and diabetes,\" he said. \"We need to address this problem directly with our students.\" \"No student should ever be able to leave Lincoln and not know the risks of obesity,\" he added. \"They could never say, 'I wish I knew this was going to happen to me, I wish someone would have told me' after suffering a heart attack or other major health problem because of their weight. James C. Turner, president of the American College Health Association and director of student health at the University of Virginia, said he had \"never heard of something like this before.\" He added that he was unaware of any studies showing a semester-long class \"to be effective to help someone lose weight in the long term.\" DeBoy said he will start collecting final semester data from the students in January so that he will be able to show, with raw numbers, that students benefited from the class. DeBoy said he taught one class where, at the beginning of the term, the 14 students struggled to walk for 15 minutes at a time. By the end, some could run for a few minutes and all could walk briskly for 45 minutes. \"All of them had BMIs well over 30,\" he said, \"and some of them lost weight, some of them did not. But not one of them gained any weight during those 15 weeks of the spring semester of their freshman year.\" Turner expressed concern that the requirement \"raises questions about personal rights and which trumps, personal rights or university policy.\" DeBoy defended the rule. \"I am not a lawyer,\" he said, \"but we test for written, oral communication skills and I do not see this as any different. We want our students to have a sound mind, but also a sound body.\"",

President Obama \"is legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behavior that were available, were not acted on,\" Jones said in an interview Wednesday with USA TODAY. \"That is two strikes,\" Obama's top White House aide on defense and foreign policy issues said, referring to the foiled bombing of the Detroit-bound airliner and the shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in November. In that case, too, officials failed to act when red flags were raised about an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Hasan. He has been charged with killing 13 people. Jones said Obama \"certainly does not want that third strike, and neither does anybody else.\" The White House plans to release an unclassified report Thursday on what went wrong in the incident involving a 23-year-old Nigerian man who tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight. THE OVAL: Obama not done with fallout from Christmas plot BEFORE ATTACK: Two in three favor full-body scanners, poll finds BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS: Three in Philly fail tests In Detroit Wednesday, the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was indicted on charges that include attempted murder and trying to use a weapon of mass destruction to kill nearly 300 people. Abdulmutallab, who faces life in prison if convicted, is to appear for the first time in federal court Friday. He has told investigators that he was trained and equipped in Yemen by a group affiliated with al-Qaeda. His father had gone to the YOU.S. Embassy in Nigeria to warn American officials that his son seemed to be turning to extremist ideology. Even so, Abdulmutallab's visa to the YOU.S. was not revoked and he was not placed on the \"no-fly\" list. Jones said the remedies involve \"tweaks\" rather than the overhaul that followed the Sept. 11 attacks- for instance, hiring for intelligence agencies so analysts are not overwhelmed by their workload. \"We know what happened, we know what did not happen, and we know how to fix it,\" Jones, a retired four-star Marine general, said in an interview in his West Wing office. \"That should be an encouraging aspect. We do not have to reinvent anything to make sure it does not happen again.\" Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said a \"very comprehensive no-fly list\" would be \"the greatest protection our country has.\" In an interview, she said the definition of who can be included should be expanded to include anyone about whom there is \"a reasonable suspicion.\" Contributing: The Associated Press Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Read more <doc_sep> Anwar al-Awlaki has also been linked to the Fort Hood shootings The alleged US plane bomber met radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, after being recruited in London, a senior Yemeni official has said. Last week US security official John Brennan said there were \"indications\" of direct contact between the two men. Mr Awlaki was linked to an attack by a US Army major on the Fort Hood base in November, in which 13 people died. Yemen's deputy prime minister also said bomb suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab used explosives from Nigeria not Yemen. Mr Abdulmutallab was indicted by a US grand jury on six counts on Wednesday. ANWAR AL-AWLAKI Born 1971 in New Mexico Sermons in San Diego, California, attended by two of 9 11 hijackers Endorsed violence as religious duty Moved to Yemen in 2004 to live in ancestral home village Jailed in 2006 for alleged plot to kidnap US military attache Advised Fort Hood suspect Maj Nidal Malik Hasan by e-mail Profile: Anwar al-Awlaki Al-Qaeda's influence in Yemen Q A: 'Jet bomber' case Charges against him include attempted murder of the 290 people aboard the plane and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Mr Abdulmutallab allegedly tried to detonate a bomb on Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit, but the plane landed safely after crew and passengers overpowered him. In a separate development, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi said that five Germans including three children and a Briton kidnapped in Yemen six months ago were still alive. He said northern Shia rebels were co-operating with al-Qaeda over the kidnap. 'Not just a cleric' Mr Alimi told journalists that Mr Abdulmutallab \"joined al-Qaeda in London\". The suspected bomber studied at University College London UCL from September 2005 to June 2008 and was president of its Islamic society in 2006-07. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has been in custody since 25 December But UCL has said there is no evidence to suggest Mr Abdulmutallab was radicalised while he was there, and UK officials responding to the Yemeni statement said they still believed his recruitment occurred in Yemen in the months before the attack. Mr Alimi said the suspect met Mr Awlaki in the cleric's ancestral home province of Shabwa. Mr Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent, has been linked to other attacks, including that carried out by Maj Nidal Malik Hasan of the US Army at the Fort Hood base in Texas in November. \"Mr Awlaki is a problem. He is clearly a part of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,\" Mr Brennan, who is US deputy national security adviser, told CNN last week. \"He is not just a cleric. He is in fact trying to instigate terrorism.\" Some reports say the cleric was killed just before the Christmas attack, in an airstrike on a suspected al-Qaeda base. However, friends and relatives say he was not harmed in the raid. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Sanaa says Yemen has been accused of soft-pedalling on al-Qaeda and is currently under pressure from its ally the US to produce results. There have been a number of shootouts recently, but the authorities have as yet been unable to capture one of their prime targets, Mohammed al-Hanouk. However, Mr Hanouk is a member of a prominent tribal family, our correspondent says, and this suggests that the government is prepared to push hard in directions it might be easier to leave alone. 'A certain shock' Confirmation of the meeting between the alleged bomber and the cleric comes as the White House plans to publish a declassified account of the Christmas Day plot. In an interview for USA Today newspaper, National Security Adviser Gen James Jones said people would feel \"a certain shock\" that clues about Mr Abdulmutallab's role were not acted on. President Barack Obama \"is legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behaviour that were available, were not acted on\", he said. Mr Obama is expected to address the nation about the incident later in the day and unveil new steps aimed at avoiding further terrorist attacks.

    "document": "Manufacturers are supposed to control programmers' distribution, but the researchers themselves got their test devices from the auction website for as little as 500 to as much as 3,000. In addition to those issues, the team has found that doctors' monitoring systems do not require log-in names and passwords when pacemakers connect to them. They even found unencrypted patients' data stored in the tools, including SSNs, names, phone numbers and medical conditions. That said, Matthew Green, an Assistant Professor for Computer Science at Johns Hopkins, noted that doctors are adamant not to let security systems block patient care. He said that requiring passwords would merely lead to a \"post-it note on the device listing the password,\" so every doctors' staff member can access the data they need. Green also called attention to some dubious parts of the study, particularly the lack of emphasis on the team's most alarming finding that third-party programmers can remotely access pacemakers: All of the other issues are kind of peripheral. If you can use your own hardware to send programming commands to a device. 7 n Matthew Green matthew_d_green May 24, 2017 Despite the points Green raised, it is still true that various security researchers have been warning manufacturers about pacemakers' and other cardiac devices' vulnerabilities for years. Unfortunately, it sounds like very few listened: a separate study by security firm Ponemon Institute LLC found that only 17 percent of manufacturers took steps to secure their products. While we have yet to hear about an incident that has led to a patient's death, it is still ideal to make cardiac devices more secure as cyberattacks become more common, elaborate and sophisticated. <doc_sep> If you need more evidence that we are living in an increasingly internet-connected world, look no further than a recent software update aimed at making sure 465,000 people with pacemakers do not have hearts that are vulnerable to hackers. The YOU.S. Food and Drug Administration announced this week that medical device company Abbott has issued a corrective action for implantable cardiac pacemakers made under the St. Jude's Medical brand. According to the company there is a \"risk of patient harm due to potential exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\" To address this heart-hacking vulnerability, Abbott is issuing a firmware update to the pacemakers. While this update is being treated as a recall, the devices will continue to function as intended \"and replacement of implanted pacemaker devices is not recommended.\" To that end, there are no known reports of patient harm related to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the 465,000 radio-frequency-enabled implanted Abbott devices impacted in the YOU.S.; the company says this firmware update is part of a plan announced in January, and will \"provide an additional layer of security against unauthorized access to these devices.\" Which devices are involved? Included in the update: Accent Anthem Accent MRI Accent ST Assurity Allure Not included: Any implantable cardiac defibrillators ICDs or cardiac resynchronization ICDs CRT-Ds Going forward, any pacemaker manufactured as of August 28, 2017 will have the update pre-loaded in the device. How to get the update If you have an impacted pacemaker, you should talk with your physician about when you should receive the update which requires an in-person patient visit as well as address any questions or concerns you might have. The process will take about three minutes to complete, during which time the device will operate in backup mode \"and essential, life-sustaining features will remain available.\" If you have any questions or want additional information, check out www.sjm.com cyberupdate, or contact Abbott's hotline at 1-800-722-3774. \"As medical devices become increasingly interconnected via the Internet, hospital networks, other medical devices, and smartphones, there is an increased risk of exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, some of which could affect how a medical device operates,\" the FDA notes. <doc_sep> Date Issued August 29, 2017 Audience Patients with a radio frequency RF -enabled St. Jude Medical implantable pacemaker Caregivers of patients with an RF-enabled St. Jude Medical implantable cardiac pacemaker Cardiologists, electrophysiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and primary care physicians treating patients with heart failure or heart rhythm problems using an RF-enabled St. Jude Medical implantable cardiac pacemaker Medical Specialties Cardiac Electrophysiology, Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart Failure Devices Abbott's formerly St. Jude Medical's implantable cardiac pacemakers, including cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker CRT-P devices, provide pacing for slow or irregular heart rhythms. These devices are implanted under the skin in the upper chest area and have connecting insulated wires called \"leads\" that go into the heart.

The devices addressed in this communication are the following St. Jude Medical pacemaker and CRT-P devices: Accent Anthem Accent MRI Accent ST Assurity Allure This communication does NOT apply to any implantable cardiac defibrillators ICDs or to cardiac resynchronization ICDs CRT-Ds Purpose On August 23, 2017, the FDA approved a firmware update that is now available and is intended as a recall, specifically a corrective action, to reduce the risk of patient harm due to potential exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities for certain Abbott formerly St. Jude Medical pacemakers. \"Firmware\" is a specific type of software embedded in the hardware of a medical device e.g. a component in the pacemaker For the purposes of this safety communication, cybersecurity focuses on protecting patients' medical devices and their associated computers, networks, programs, and data from unintended or unauthorized access, change, or destruction. The FDA recommends that patients and their health care providers discuss the risks and benefits of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the associated firmware update designed to address such vulnerabilities at their next regularly scheduled visit. Summary of Problem and Scope Many medical devices including St. Jude Medical's implantable cardiac pacemakers contain configurable embedded computer systems that can be vulnerable to cybersecurity intrusions and exploits. As medical devices become increasingly interconnected via the Internet, hospital networks, other medical devices, and smartphones, there is an increased risk of exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, some of which could affect how a medical device operates. The FDA has reviewed information concerning potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with St. Jude Medical's RF-enabled implantable cardiac pacemakers and has confirmed that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow an unauthorized user i.e. someone other than the patient's physician to access a patient's device using commercially available equipment. This access could be used to modify programming commands to the implanted pacemaker, which could result in patient harm from rapid battery depletion or administration of inappropriate pacing. There are no known reports of patient harm related to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the 465,000 US implanted devices impacted. To address these cybersecurity vulnerabilities and improve patient safety, St. Jude Medical has developed and validated this firmware update as a corrective action recall for all of their RF-enabled pacemaker devices, including cardiac resynchronization pacemakers. The FDA has approved St. Jude Medical's firmware update to ensure that it addresses these cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and reduces the risk of exploitation and subsequent patient harm. After installing this update, any device attempting to communicate with the implanted pacemaker must provide authorization to do so. The Merlin Programmer and Merlin home Transmitter will provide such authorization. The firmware update will be available beginning August 29, 2017. Pacemakers manufactured beginning August 28, 2017 will have this update pre-loaded in the device and will not need the update. Firmware Update Details The firmware update requires an in-person patient visit with a health care provider it cannot be done from home via Merlin.net. The update process will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. During this time, the device will operate in backup mode pacing at 67 beats per minute and essential, life-sustaining features will remain available. At the completion of the update, the device will return to its pre-update settings. As with any firmware update, there is a very low risk of an update malfunction. Based on St. Jude Medical's previous firmware update experience, installing the updated firmware could potentially result in the following malfunctions including the rate of occurrence previously observed reloading of previous firmware version due to incomplete update 0.161 percent loss of currently programmed device settings 0.023 percent loss of diagnostic data none reported or complete loss of device functionality 0.003 percent Recommendations for Health Care Providers: The FDA and Abbott do NOT recommend prophylactic removal and replacement of affected devices. Discuss the risks and benefits of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and associated firmware update with your patients at the next regularly scheduled visit. As part of this discussion, it is important to consider each patient's circumstances, such as pacemaker dependence, age of the device, and patient preference, and provide them with Abbott's Patient Guide. Determine if the update is appropriate for the given patient based on the potential benefits and risks. If deemed appropriate, install the firmware update following the instructions on the programmer. For pacing dependent patients, consider performing the cybersecurity firmware update in a facility where temporary pacing and pacemaker generator can be readily provided. Print or digitally store the programmed device settings and the diagnostic data in case of loss during the update. After the update, confirm that the device maintains its functionality, is not in backup mode, and that the programmed parameters have not changed. The firmware update process is described in Abbott's Dear Doctor Letter issued on August 28, 2017. Contact your Abbott representative, or Abbott's customer technical support hotline at 18007223774 if you have any questions about the firmware update. Recommendations for Patients and Caregivers Consult with your physician s for determining when you should receive the update and if you have any questions or concerns about the vulnerabilities or the update. Your ongoing medical management should be based on your own medical history and clinical condition. Visit www.sjm.com cyberupdate, or contact Abbott's hotline at 1-800-722-3774 for additional information, or if you have any questions or issues regarding your St. Jude Medical implantable cardiac pacemaker. FDA Actions The FDA will continue to assess new information concerning the cybersecurity of Abbott's implantable cardiac devices and the Merlin home Transmitter, and will keep the public informed if the FDA's recommendations change. The FDA reminds patients, patient caregivers, and health care providers that any medical device connected to a communications network e.g. wi-fi, public or home Internet may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could be exploited by unauthorized users. However, the increased use of wireless technology and software in medical devices can also often offer safer, more efficient, convenient, and timely health care delivery. The FDA will continue its work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations-as well as security researchers and other government agencies-to develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device's total product lifecycle. The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices very seriously and has issued recommendations to manufacturers for continued monitoring, reporting, and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Reporting Problems to the FDA Prompt reporting of adverse events can help the FDA identify and better understand the risks related to the use of medical devices. If you suspect or experience a problem with these devices, we encourage you to file a voluntary report through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program. Health care personnel employed by facilities that are subject to the FDA's user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their facilities.

    "reference_summary": "Is it a recall? Is it a software update? Well, it is actually both. Abbott, the medical device company that produces implantable cardiac pacemakers under the St. Jude's Medical brand, has issued a \"corrective action,\" per the Food and Drug Administration, to mitigate what it calls the \"risk of patient harm due to potential exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\" That is right, it is asking 465,000 people with certain devices to visit their doctors and get a firmware update so that their implants are not so easy to hack into. They say patients should schedule a visit with their doctor, and that the process will take three minutes start to finish, during which time all essential features will run in backup mode, reports Consumerist. It is unclear how many people in other countries are affected. Over the past decade, there is been an increase in reports of serious vulnerabilities in pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other medical devices, reports Ars Technica. That is because they are now outfitted with tiny radio-frequency equipment for remote maintenance that no longer requires new and costly surgeries when the devices need updating. Back in May, Engadget reported that security company WhiteScope found 8,000 bugs hackers could exploit in pacemaker programs alone. While attackers must be within 50 feet of the device to hack into it, and no one has yet to die from a cyber attack, some argue that the mere threat of an attack is reason enough to make these devices as sophisticated and protected as possible. One pacemaker was used in an arson investigation.",

    "document": "The USA leads the world in obesity, but it is far from the only country with a weight problem. Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP By sheer numbers, the USA handily leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people 13 of the total for a country with 5 of the population, a new report says. But we are hardly alone in our battle with bulges: Obesity is a growing problem worldwide and, by proportion, is even worse in some other countries, says the study to be published Thursday in the medical journal Lancet. Rates are rising among men, women and children, in rich countries and in poor countries, the report says. \"It is going up everywhere,\" says study co-author Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington-Seattle. The new 188-country study is the most comprehensive look at obesity worldwide over the past several decades, and it paints a discouraging picture, Murray says: \"The most concerning thing is that there is not a single country that has seen a decline in obesity in the past thirty years. We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto. But there is a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" Obesity is more common in developed countries than in poorer nations, but it is rising in both, the report says. Throughout the world including in the USA obesity co-exists with pockets of hunger, Murray says. Among the details: The number of overweight or obese individuals worldwide increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. That is nearly 30 of the world's population, up from about 20 About one-third of adults in the USA are overweight with a body mass index of 25 or above and another third are obese with a body mass index of 30 or above as has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity rates are even higher in some countries, exceeding 50 among men in Tonga and among women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Samoa and Tonga. \"Those are extraordinary levels,\" Murray says. About 22 of girls and 24 of boys in developed countries are overweight or obese. So are 13 of boys and girls in developing countries. In the USA and other developed countries, increases in obesity have slowed; in developing countries, rates are accelerating. The new study does not examine causes but lists possibilities, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity and even changes in the mix of bacteria that live in human guts in the modern world. The report notes that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world. That seems to support a theory, advanced by another recent study, that a major because of obesity is that food has become cheap relative to income. \"It is not just cheaper in terms of money. It is also more accessible and more available all the time in the form of prepackaged junky food that is not necessarily conducive to health,\" says Roland Sturm, a senior economist at RAND and co-author of that study, published last week in CA: Cancer Journal for Clinicians. \"It is a good thing that hunger has decreased,\" Sturm says, \"but now we have to deal with another health issue.\" This month, the World Health Organization launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions. A report is due in early 2015.

WASHINGTON Obesity is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on the world's population in rich and poor nations alike, with almost 30 percent of people globally now either obese or overweight a staggering 2.1 billion in all, researchers said on Wednesday. The researchers conducted what they called the most comprehensive assessment to date of one of the pressing public health dilemmas of our time, using data covering 188 nations from 1980 to 2013. Nations in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America and the Pacific and Caribbean islands reached staggeringly high obesity rates, the team at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle reported in the Lancet medical journal. The biggest obesity rises among women came in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras and Bahrain. Among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United States. The richest country, the United States, was home to the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population 13 percent even though it claims less than 5 percent of its people. Obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, diabetes, arthritis and certain cancers. Chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually, the YOU.N. World Health Organization says. During the 33 years studied, rates of being obese or overweight soared 28 percent in adults and 47 percent in children. During that span, the number of overweight and obese people rose from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. That number exceeds the total world population of 1927, when it first hit 2 billion. Earth's population now tops 7 billion. The researchers said obesity once a malady of rich nations now grips people of all ages, incomes and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" said Marie Ng, a global health professor who was one of the researchers. The problem was most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with more than 58 percent of adult men and 65 percent of adult women overweight or obese. Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait saw big increases. \"We have to remind ourselves that obesity is really not a cosmetic issue. It is a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality,\" added global health professor Ali Mokdad, another of the researchers. Obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50 percent in children and adolescents worldwide. Men tallied higher rates in developed countries. Women did so in developing countries. There was a possible ray of hope in rich countries, with the rate of increase in adult obesity slowing in the past eight years. More than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan and Indonesia.

Thumper was one of up to 16 San Jose cats slain by Robert Farmer, 26. Photo: Myriam Martinez Myriam Martinez Photo: Myriam Martinez Myriam Martinez Image 1 of 1 Caption Close San Jose serial cat killer gets 16-year sentence 1 1 Back to Gallery A serial cat killer in San Jose who pleaded guilty to torturing and dismembering a number of beloved neighborhood felines was sentenced Friday to a maximum term of 16 years in jail. Robert Farmer, 26, pleaded guilty in October to 21 felony counts of animal cruelty. Though Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sharon Chatman imposed the strictest sentence she could on Farmer, she did not require him to register as a sex offender as county prosecutors had requested. Prosecutors and owners of the cats alleged that Farmer had sexually abused one of the slain felines, but the judge rejected that argument. The owners of the dead cats police say he killed up to 16 of them, though only four bodies were recovered say that Farmer terrorized their Cambrian Park neighborhood in south San Jose for months, causing pet owners to keep outdoor cats inside as animal after animal disappeared. Gayle Goodson, a self-described cat-lover who owns three felines and supporter of those who lost their pets, said the courtroom was packed. There were tears when pet owners spoke about \"their beloved cats and what they meant to them,\" Goodson said, followed by a \"big sigh of relief\" when Farmer was sentenced. \"We are disappointed that the judge did not\" require Farmer to register as a sex offender, Goodson said, \"but we understand her reasoning, though we may not necessarily agree with it.\" Dozens of animal rights activists had joined the victims in demanding a stringent sentence for Farmer, spurred on by an online petition that gathered tens of thousands of signatures. The bereaved cat lovers started a campaign to hold Farmer accountable writing letters to the judge, calling up the district attorney's office and creating memes demanding justice on a Facebook group called \"Justice for our CATZ.\" Because he does not have to register as a sex offender, Farmer will serve his time with almost two years in credit for time served in county jail, not state prison. His attorney, Wesley Schroeder, said his client could be released in as little as 412 years. \"He got max sentence 16 YEARS a woman wrote on the Facebook group, adding a thumbs-up emoji. The woman wrote that Farmer \"was murdering animals in the neighborhood where he grew up, among people who trusted him.\" Others chimed in, commenting that it was \"too bad\" that the judge did not include the sex offender requirement. When Farmer is released, he will have to register for probation until the terms of his entire 16-year sentence are satisfied. Conditions of his probation include staying away from Cambrian Park, not owning or caring for any animal for 10 years and undergoing mandatory psychological treatment. Police said they arrested Farmer in October 2015 inside a car, where they found a beaten and bloody corpse of a cat in a garbage bag, along with an assortment of collars. Schroeder said the county's probation officer had recommended a sentence of nine years, which the judge nearly doubled. The attorney had argued that Farmer had for years before the cat killings lived with an increasing number of mental health issues, for which he had received no treatment. That, coupled with a methamphetamine addiction, did not excuse Farmer's \"horrific\" actions, he said. But Schroeder said Farmer's long-running addiction acted as an \"accelerant\" to a spiral of problems that resulted in the death of the felines. \"The underlying problem was that the match had already been lit, but the meth just made it more extensive,\" Schroeder said. Farmer was stuck in a \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation,\" Schroeder said, adding that he hoped he would be able to help Farmer obtain counseling and medication while in jail so this does not happen again. <doc_sep> A San Jose man was sentenced to 16 years in jail today for killing 21 cats and sexually abusing a dead one, a bittersweet outcome for those whose pets began disappearing almost two years ago. Santa Clara Superior Court Judge Sharon A. Chatman credited Robert Roy Farmer, 26, for twice the 646 days he already has served since his arrest for crimes that shocked the Cambrian Park community where most of the cats were abducted. Farmer will not have to register as a sex offender when he is eventually released, a proposed sentencing condition that had become a point of contention between his attorney Wesley Schroeder and Deputy District Attorney Alexandra Ellis. Schroeder had argued that a test performed by a San Jose Animal Services and Care veterinarian showed no signs of a cat having been sexually assaulted by Farmer. But the same veterinarian testified during a pre-sentencing hearing in May that the possibility could not be eliminated because other physical exams showed otherwise and \"because limited literature in this field says there may be no injuries at all on an animal.\" Before the sentencing, Schroeder read a letter written by Farmer, in which he said \"it feels like another man committed these crimes, but I know it was me.\" \"It is so hard to grasp I did this,\" Farmer wrote, adding that he grew up with cats and horses. \"I stole a member of their family. The fact that I was out of my mind was no excuse.\" Ellis dismissed the letter as \"manipulation\" that contradicts his previous interviews with police, written by a disturbed individual with no hope for rehabilitation. Because of Farmer's antisocial personality disorder diagnosis by a court doctor, she urged the judge to consider mental health reports that state he had a \"profound lack of empathy and remorse\" for his crimes and \"significant anger\" toward his family. The doctor also considered him a possible danger to the community, with a prognosis for recovery that was \"poor, with potential escalation to higher life forms in the future.\" The bizarre saga unfolded in September 2015 when cats began mysteriously disappearing from the Cambrian Park neighborhood. Stories started to spread among neighbors about a man who had tried luring two cats into a backpack. One cat escaped and was later treated by a veterinarian for a \"bite that was not an animal bite, as well as the bleeding head injury,\" Cambrian resident David Stine said at the time. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from San Jose, the Bay Area and beyond. Several cats subsequently turned up dead, including two discovered in a dumpster. And Cambrian resident Janice McKimmie's 15-year-old cat Beardsly was found dead several miles away wrapped in plastic inside a shoebox with his collar missing and rocks placed on the lid. Stine was surprised when McKimmie said her cat went missing the same morning as did his 16-year-old orange tabby cat Chablis, who still has not been seen to this day. Video footage from Miriam Petrova's security camera later that week showed a young man grabbing a 17-year-old orange tabby cat named GoGo from her front porch. Neighbors soon after helped San Jose police identify Farmer as the man in the video, though no trace of GoGo was ever found. Farmer, the son of a retired San Jose Police Department captain, was found the morning of October 8, 2015 at a Home Depot parking lot near Hillsdale and Leigh avenues. He was sleeping inside his car with a dead cat curled up in the center console when police officers apprehended him. Chunks of fur and streaks of blood covered the interior of Farmer's vehicle, where police also found a backpack with a pair of fur-covered gloves and a hunting knife in a sheath. Farmer was originally charged with three felony counts of animal cruelty, one count of attempted animal cruelty, and one misdemeanor count each of battery and being under the influence. Subsequent DNA tests on blood, fur and other items found in Farmer's car eventually shot that number up to 21 charges of felony animal cruelty-one for each of his feline victims. Family members and others who knew Farmer told police they were often terrified around him. An elderly woman who let Farmer stay with her and her grandson shortly before his arrest recounted him tying up the back legs of her cat Angel and smacking it against a wall. One time she said Farmer hit her grandson in the face, unprovoked, and on another occasion he shot the same boy in the leg with a pellet gun. Her grandson also told her that Farmer had commented once about \"what it would feel like to kill a person.\" The case took a shocking twist when a necropsy report from Animal Services found signs of sexual abuse on the orange female tabby cat inside the car, including dilated genitals. Crime laboratory reports also stated a match was discovered between Farmer and DNA found under claw clippings. Schroeder contested the prosecution's argument that the cat was sexually abused. The conflicting accounts triggered a debate about whether Farmer should be required to register as a sex offender when someday released from prison. Ellis argued that Farmer's molestation of the dead cat was sexually motivated but Schroeder proffered other theories. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store. \"Doing something to the body in that area does not necessarily indicate sexual motivation,\" Schroeder said, adding that Farmer's methamphetamine use at the time could have contributed to his behavior. Torture was another possibility that Schroeder also mentioned but Ellis said that was not possible. \"You cannot torture a dead cat,\" she said. \"If there was an animal cruelty registry then Mr. Farmer would be the perfect picture for that,\" Chatman said. But the judge declined to require Farmer to register as a sex offender upon release, stating that Ellis' arguments \"did not meet that burden\" for such an order. \"We do not have experts to form an opinion that similar conduct was sexually motivated,\" Chatman told Ellis. \"The entire veterinary community does not study it and so it is not a piece of evidence I can put on your side of the scale.\" But the judge ordered him to stay away from cats for 10 years after his release and away from the 95124 Cambrian Park ZIP code area. Throngs of people crowded outside the courtroom in anticipation of the long-awaited sentencing. Many of the owners whose cats fell victim to Farmer read statements in the courtroom expressing their grief and outrage before he was sentenced. Farmer listened with his back turned to the crowd. Petrova wept as she told onlookers how \"our sweet GoGo\" would cuddle in bed with her children and mourned the fact that \"we did not have the chance to say a proper goodbye.\" \"It is still painful to come home knowing GoGo is not waiting for us,\" Petrova said. \"Now the only image burned in our minds is GoGo running for his life\" on camera as Farmer chased after him. \"GoGo never hurt anybody,\" she added, before addressing Farmer directly: \"And for you, Robert Farmer-what have you done to GoGo? Where is he?\" Although she had hoped Farmer would have to register as a sex offender, Petrova said she is \"relieved\" that the ordeal is finally over. \"When I spoke up to Farmer I felt relieved,\" she said. \"It will be not closure completely, but partially.\"",

Associated Press This photo released by the National Search and Rescue Agency BASARNAS of Indonesia Monday, August 17,2015 shows the part of the wreckage that BASARNAS identified as of the missing Trigana Air Service. Associated Press More than 70 rescuers reached the crash site only on Tuesday after being hindered by rugged, forested terrain and bad weather. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, the plane's \"black boxes,\" were found in good condition, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, the National Search and Rescue Agency chief. The data they contain could help explain what caused the crash. \"The plane was totally destroyed and all the bodies were burned and difficult to identify,\" Soelistyo told The Associated Press. He said all 54 bodies had been recovered and will be taken to Jayapura, the capital of Papua province, so they can be identified. The Trigana Air Service plane was flying from Jayapura to the city of Oksibil with 49 passengers and five crew members on a scheduled 42-minute flight when it lost contact Sunday. Soelistyo said the wreckage was at an altitude of 2,600 meters about 8,500 feet Much of Papua is covered with impenetrable jungles and mountains. Some planes that have crashed in the past have never been found. The airline's crisis center official in Jayapura's Sentani airport, Budiono, said all the passengers were Indonesians, and included three local government officials and two members of the local parliament who were to attend a ceremony Monday in Oksibil marking the 70th anniversary of Indonesia's independence from Dutch colonial rule. Oksibil, about 280 kilometers 175 miles south of Jayapura, was experiencing heavy rain, strong winds and fog when the plane lost contact with the airport minutes before it was scheduled to land. The victims' relatives, who had been waiting at the airport, broke down in tears when they heard the news. Many of them accused the airline of taking too long to give them information. \"They are unprofessional they play with our feelings of grieving,\" said Cory Gasper, whose brother Jhon Gasper was on the plane. The airline released a public apology just after a search plane spotted the smoldering wreckage of the ATR42-300 twin turboprop on Monday. It was unclear what caused the caused the crash, Indonesia's transportation safety commission has opened an investigation. The passengers included four postal workers escorting four bags of cash totaling 468,750 in government aid for poor families to help offset a spike in fuel prices, Franciscus Haryono, the head of the post office in Jayapura, the provincial capital, told The Associated Press. Indonesia has had a string of airline tragedies in recent years. In December, all 162 people aboard an AirAsia jet were killed when the plane plummeted into the Java Sea as it flew through stormy weather on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, to Singapore. The sprawling archipelago nation of 250 million people and some 17,000 islands is one of Asia's most rapidly expanding airline markets, but it is struggling to provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety. From 2007 to 2009, the European Union barred Indonesian airlines from flying to Europe because of safety concerns. Trigana Air Service, which began operations in 1991, had 22 aircraft as of December 2013 and flies to 21 destinations in Indonesia. The carrier has had 19 serious incidents since 1992, resulting in the loss of eight aircraft and major damage to 11 others, according to the Aviation Safety Network's online database. The airline remains banned from flying to Europe along with other six Indonesian airlines. _ Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report. <doc_sep> JAKARTA All 54 people on board a Trigana Air aircraft were killed in a crash two days ago in Indonesia's Papua province, the latest in a string of aviation disasters in the Southeast Asian archipelago, officials said on Tuesday. Major-General Heronimus Guru, operations director at Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency, told a news conference in the capital the passengers' remains were being put into body bags but poor weather had hampered efforts to recover them by air. Officials have declined to comment on the because of Sunday's crash until the results of an investigation by the national transport safety committee are known, but Guru said the terrain in Indonesia's easternmost province may have been a factor. \"There is a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found in is steep,\" he said. The treacherous terrain of forest-covered ridges hampered rescuers' efforts to reach the site where the Trigana Air Service ATR 42-300 plane came down. The aircraft's black box flight recorder, which should provide investigators with some answers, was found in the early afternoon. The device will be taken to Oksibil town tomorrow, depending on the weather, Guru said. Television broadcast footage of rescuers in camouflage fatigues and surgical masks hacking through foliage and sifting through debris at the crash site as a helicopter hovered overhead. There were 44 adult passengers, five children and infants and five crew on the short-haul flight from provincial capital Jayapura south to Oksibil. The twin turboprop aircraft was also carrying about 470,000 as part of a village assistance program. Poor infrastructure in the province means aid money is often flown in by air, said Abu Sofjan, spokesman for the national postal service, four of whose workers were among the passengers. There was no suggestion the money was somehow linked to the crash. Five members of the Bintang Highlands district parliament and government were also on board, online news service detik.com reported. Reuters was not able to verify the report. All on board were Indonesian, officials have said. Officials of Trigana, placed on a European Union list of banned carriers since 2007 over safety or regulatory concerns, were not immediately available for comment. The aircraft made its first flight 27 years ago, online database Aviation Safety Network says. Trigana Air Service has a fleet of 14 aircraft, which are 26.6 years old on average, according to the airfleets.net database. Trigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, Aviation Safety Network says. Besides the latest crash, it has written off 10 aircraft. Indonesia has a patchy aviation record, with two other major crashes in the past year. In December, an AirAsia flight went down in the Java Sea, killing all 162 on board. More than 100 people died in June in the crash of a military transport plane. Indonesia scored poorly on a 2014 safety audit by the YOU.N. aviation agency, largely because its Ministry of Transportation is understaffed, said two sources familiar with the matter, as the country struggles to cope with the rapid expansion of air travel.

The teams on the ground have so far seen at least 38 bodies at the scene and have not found any survivors, said Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency. Helicopters are being deployed to the densely forested area in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua to begin the evacuation process, he said. The airliner, operated by the Indonesian carrier Trigana Air Service, lost contact with air traffic control Sunday about half an hour into a short flight from the provincial capital to a town in the mountains. Search planes spotted debris on a mountainside Monday, but efforts to try to reach it on foot and by helicopter were suspended until Tuesday because of fog. Read More",

    "document": "Activists opposed to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea marched on the Chinese embassy in Manila Friday, further escalating the two countries' territorial dispute. Huangyan Island is a small, rocky outcrop of land about 220 kilometers from the Philippine mainland of Luzon. Tensions in the region escalated on April 10 when the Philippines accused Chinese vessels of illegally fishing in Philippine territory. Reuters On Friday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei blamed the Philippines for rising tensions between the two countries. He said the Philippines side encouraged people to hold anti-China embassy protests, an action that complicates and magnifies the situation. Hong said China pays great attention to the safety of Chinese nationals in the Philippines and has demanded the Philippines take effective measures to earnestly protect the safety of Chinese nationals and institutions in the Philippines. The dispute has become an issue of national pride for some Chinese. Small groups of protesters marched in front of the Philippine embassy in Beijing, Friday. \"I believe this Huayuan Island is an inseparable part of China. I hope their governments do not make this a because for bad relations,\" one protester said. The protest in Manila was much larger than the one in Beijing. Hundreds of protesters marched in front of the Chinese embassy many carrying placards that read: \"China Back Off.\" \"The main objective of the protest action is to call the attention of the international community with regards to the Chinese government's continuing and escalating intrusions in the Panatag Scarborough shoal area which we strongly believe is an integral part of the Philippine territory,\" explained Emma Hizon, one of the organizers. The standoff escalated in April when China sent two maritime surveillance ships to prevent the Philippines from arresting Chinese fishermen off Huangyan Island. A Philippines coast guard vessel is currently facing off with the two Chinese ships. Several countries claim parts of the South China Sea, including Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. The waterway is a strategically important trade route and a potentially rich source of oil and natural gas in the region. But Chinese officials have ramped up warnings in recent weeks about the territorial dispute, with state-backed newspapers warning of \"small-scale war\" if the Philippines does not back off. China warned its citizens in the Philippines to be cautious and the China International Travel Service, a large government-run travel agency, said it was postponing trips to the Philippines because of the protests. The standoff is also affecting trade between the two countries. In what may be a punitive action by the Chinese government, 1,200 containers of bananas from the Philippines are being held in customs because of what authorities say are \"quarantine concerns\". Meanwhile civic groups in the Philippines say they are planning more protests outside of Chinese missions in New York, Singapore and Rome. <doc_sep> Footage aired by Chinese broadcaster Dragon TV showed Zhang Fan hoisting the flag during his report from Huangyan island as he explained the history of the long-standing territorial dispute between China and the Philippines Both countries claim the Scarborough Shoal, which is known as Panatag Shoal to Filipinos or Huangyan island to the Chinese. Territorial rivalry has escalated over the small rocky outpost during the last month as the Philippines have attempted to scale back an expanding Chinese presence in the potentially oil-rich South China Sea. Beijing and Manila have been locked in a high seas stand-off since the PLA Navy prevented a Philippine warship from arresting crews of Chinese fishing boats near the Scarborough Shoal on April 8. Both countries claim the fish rich shoal as their own and protests by Philippine fishermen over their loss of livelihood have drawn mass support in the south-east Asian country. About 400 activists marched to the Chinese embassy in Manila on Friday to protest against what they call Chinese encroachment on the disputed shoal. After China warned its Philippine-based citizens to \"stay indoors\" earlier this week as tensions mounted, Emman Hizon, spokesperson of the Filipino protesters, said the demonstrations should not alarm Chinese residents. \"We reiterate our statement to the Chinese nationals: they have nothing to worry about. This is not a protest action against them; this is a protest action to manifest our indignation against the Chinese government's policy and military still approaching in the Panatag Shoal area,\" he said.",

One Chinese TV station aired footage of a reporter defiantly raising China's flag on one of those rocks.

    "document": "In a setback to Johnson Johnson, a Philadelphia jury decided the health care giant must pay 2.5 million in damages for failing to warn that its Risperdal antipsychotic could cause gynecomastia, which is abnormal development of breasts in males. The lawsuit was brought by the family of an autistic boy who took the drug in 2002 and later developed size 46 DD breasts, according to a lawyer for the family. The case has drawn attention for a few reasons. For one, this was the first lawsuit claiming J J hid the risks of gynecomastia to go to trial after a handful of cases were settled. The trial also served as a reminder that J J paid 2.2 billion two years ago to resolve criminal and civil allegations of illegally marketing Risperdal to children and the elderly. Moreover, former FDA commissioner David Kessler served as a paid expert witness for the family and testified that J J knew about the risks. <doc_sep> Gynecomastia, enlargement of breast tissue in males, was an adverse effect of using the antipsychotic drug Risperdal, OKd for schizophrenic adults in 1993. AN ALABAMA man who grew enormous breasts after taking an antipsychotic drug as a boy was awarded 2.5 million in damages in a Philadelphia court yesterday against the Johnson Johnson subsidiary that makes the pill. A Common Pleas jury concluded that Austin Pledger, now 20, \"was not adequately warned\" that he would grow size 46DD breasts as a side effect of using Risperdal, produced by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, according to his lawyer, Thomas Kline. \"This trial is important publicly,\" Kline told the Daily News yesterday, \"because it provided for the first time a public window into the real risks of this drug.\" A spokeswoman for Janssen, located in Titusville, N.J., said the firm is \"disappointed\" and \"believes this verdict should be overturned,\" claiming that Risperdal's side effects were clearly communicated to Pledger, his family and the prescribing doctor. Pledger, a native of Thorsby, Ala., was first prescribed the drug in 2002 by his family physician, Kline said. At the time, Risperdal was not approved by the YOU.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children Pledger, who has autism, was 8 years old when the prescription was written and its label reported that the risk of gynecomastia, a condition that causes men to grow female breasts, was low, according to Kline. However, in 2006, the FDA approved Risperdal's use as a schizophrenic aid for children and issued new label information that said the drug contained high levels of prolactin, a hormone that promotes breast growth, Kline said. By that time, Pledger already had begun to develop breasts. To this day, Pledger has female-like breasts that can only be removed through a mastectomy, Kline said. Robyn Reed Frenze, Janssen's director of product communication, said that the firm rejects these claims and that the FDA-approved label \"properly warned\" the boy's family \"of the medication's potential side effects.\" She added that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal.\" The jurors apparently disagreed. Pledger's case is the first of more than 1,200 filed in Philly over Risperdal to be settled, according to Kline. On Twitter: Vellastrations <doc_sep> Alabama Man Awarded 2.5 Million in Damages After a Drug Allegedly Gave Him Breasts A Philadelphia Common Pleas jury Tuesday awarded 2.5 million in damages to an Alabama man with autism who took the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal as a teen and grew size 46DD breasts, according to Thomas Kline the man's attorney.\"This trial is important publicly because it provided for the first time a window into the real risks of the drug,\" Kline told the Philadelphia Daily News It is the first of thousands of such cases nationwide 1,200 are pending in the Philadelphia court alone to get a jury verdict, Kline tells PEOPLE.His client, Austin Pledger, now 20, of Thorsby, Alabama, was ruled incapacitated by the courts, so his mother, Benita Pledger, testified about the impact instead, he says.\"The testimony of his mother before the jury is he would smash them on a table,\" he says. \"And that when he gets out of the shower he covers himself in a towel before he looks at himself in a mirror.\"A spokeswoman for the drug's manufacturer, Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson Johnson, sent PEOPLE a news release saying the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and is considering all its options, including appeals.\"We firmly believe this verdict should be overturned,\" the statement said. \"Risperdal has improved the lives of countless children and adults throughout the world.\"Furthermore, the company says the drug has labels that detail the side effects, and Pledger's physician was aware of them as well.But Kline says Pledger's mother did not know about the risks when he began taking it in 2002 at age 8 to deal with the irritability associated with autism. The drug was not approved for children and adolescents until late 2006.\"She had no idea that it was associated with the growing of female breasts,\" he says. \"Austin is among the most vulnerable and precious in our world.\"Austin's doctor, Jay Mathisen, testified he was unaware gynecomastia, the name of the condition, could result from use of the drug, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer Austin can only get rid of his breasts with a mastectomy, Kline says, which he has not yet done.\"He has only now been through his teenage years,\" he says. \"These decisions are difficult and even more so when the child is frail, like Austin, so his mom has been very slow and patient.\"Meanwhile, Austin is \"most proud of his facial hair\" because he wants to be like his dad, Kline says, though every day he sees \"that he is like his mom.\"",

    "document": "The Unabomber thought so highly of his environmental manifesto that he threatened to keep killing if the New York Times and Washington Post did not publish it. But 15 years after he was arrested at his remote cabin outside Lincoln, Mont., his twisted words seem to be worth less than his ratty sweatshirt. The YOU.S. Marshall's office is currently holding an online auction of the personal effects of Ted Kaczynski, who, between 1978 and 1995, engaged in a mail bombing spree, killing three people and injuring 23 others. The 68-year-old terrorist is currently serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colo. The auction of his belongings ends June 2 and all the money raised will be used to pay off a 15 million restitution order to his victims and their families. Since Kaczynski's actions were designed to protest modern society's \"industrial-technological system,\" there are not nearly enough possessions on the auction block to raise 15 million, especially because his most valuable possession the cabin he built in the Montana wilderness is now on display in the Washington, D.C. Newseum. Still, at least two items are getting some serious bids: His 35,000 word handwritten manifesto currently has a bid of 17,525, while the iconic hoodie made famous by the artistic rendering in the FBI's \"Wanted\" poster is up to 20,025 though for that price, the successful bidder will also receive a pair of sunglasses. Another item attracting interest is Kaczynski's Smith-Corona typewriter. Bids for that are currently around the 11,000 mark. Story continues below Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Other items have attracted less attention. The top bid for a hand-bowed wood saw that Kaczynski used is currently only 310, while handwritten letters to his Aunt Frida are only getting bids around 250. Of course, some people might say it is a sad sign of the times that the auction is even taking place, and you will not get an argument from art historian and appraiser Elyse Luray, who is best known for her work on the PBS series \"History Detectives.\" But she still believes there is value to be found in the auction. \"I hate to say it, but there is some collectibility in this auction,\" Luray told AOL Weird News. \"This is one of the most tragic events in YOU.S. history and the manifesto has historical value as does the typewriter that he used to type his two manifestos. You have to take the emotion out of it.\" Luray dismisses most of what is being sold, figuring it is only going to be of value to \"some weird who wants something belonging to the Unabomber.\" Still, she can see why something as mundane as Kaczynski's hand saw might be selling for much more than its actually worth. \"Hype increases value,\" she said. \"On the other hand, things like Marilyn Monroe's dresses or Liz Taylor's jewelry will retain value over the years.\" Still, crime memorabilia collectors like Scott Michaels think there is a lot of value in being able to tell friends and neighbors that the saw they are borrowing was once used by the Unabomber. Michaels is the proprietor of Dearly Departed Tours, a company that shows crime aficionados visiting Los Angeles all the city's most infamous crime-oriented sights. But Michaels is also a collector who has in his possession some extraordinary pieces of macabre memorabilia, including a piece of John Denver's plane, a hunk of the Hindenberg, and a tile from the swimming pool where Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones drowned. He also owns a clown painting made by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Michaels makes no bones about his hobby unless, of course, he chooses to buy one for his collection but admits he often has to defend it. \"This is history I choose to embrace,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I do not understand why people collect coins. You know, this is more common than people want to admit. Take a look at Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The people that are going there are basically there to see where JFK was shot.\" From an objective viewpoint, he can see the value in the Unabomber's hoodie. \"That hoodie is iconic,\" he said. \"It really is the 'tah-dah' item, but the documents are interesting too.\" Yet if he were to bid on an item himself, Michaels knows which one he would choose. \"I would gravitate towards the saw,\" Michaels said. \"I like the human touch, knowing that he probably used it. I remember when they were doing a Marilyn Monroe auction. I never could have afforded the dresses, but I did purchase some golf course pencils that were stuck in her junk drawer.\" Sadly, Michaels does not have the room in his house to hold his entire collection. Much of it is in storage, where it will remain until he is able to open an office-slash-museum large enough for his creepy collectibles. Although the market for crime memorabilia might seem to be new, criminologist Jeffery Ian Ross Ph.D. says it is been going on for a few hundred years. \"Ever since the invention of the printing press, the public hase been fascinated by crime,\" Ross said. \"I think the reason that the memorabilia has a certain appeal is partially motivated by boredom and voyeurism and a desire to have a connection with what is going on in the news.\" By the way, if you are thinking of jumping in on the auction at the last minute hoping to get rich off the Unabomber's memorabilia, Michaels has one word of advice: Do not! \"I could not imagine buying any of this in order to make money,\" he said. \"This is more about having something that you find interesting to own. It is kind of fun to say, 'Hey, Jeffrey Dahmer used to own that video cassette of 'Exorcist III.'\" <doc_sep> Behind all the muscle and good looks that make up Twilight beefcake Kellan Lutz, there is a mushy charitable soul who is doing his part along with a bunch of fellow celebs by auctioning off some luggage for a good because.

    "document": "Photo by 1000 Words Shutterstock Debra Harrell, 46, let her 9-year-old daughter play outside alone at the park. The South Carolina child had a cellphone she could use to call her mother in case of emergency. On the girl's third day alone at the park, someone asked her where her mother was. The girl said her mom was at work. Harrell works at McDonald's and did not want her daughter to have to sit inside the restaurant for hours on a beautiful summer day. The result? Harrell was arrested for \"unlawful conduct towards a child\" and put in jail; her daughter is now in the custody of the department of social services. Most commentators-save for a few busybodies interviewed by the local news who nattered on about the possibility of the child being abducted by a strange man, something that is extremely rare-think that authorities went way too far in arresting Harrell. It angers me, as a citizen, to see the police overreach this way. How is it benefiting this child to be put in the custody of social services? And since I am a parent, Harrell's arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested? Advertisement I asked Dorothy Roberts, a professor of law, sociology, and civil rights at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare, if state laws give any specifics about how parents should behave. As in, if you leave a child of X years alone for Y amount of time, it is a crime. Roberts responded via email: The short answer is that every state has its own child maltreatment laws and definitions of neglect-and they are all very vague with no specifics. Most include within neglect failure to provide adequate supervision. South Carolina's child welfare law is actually more specific than most, but still does not specify the age-\"supervision appropriate to the child's age and development.\" But how does the judge jury determine what is appropriate? I do not know of any law that specifies the age or the precise nature of failure to supervise. Roberts further explained that states determine whether to treat neglect as a crime or as a child welfare matter. She says it is \"recent and rare\" for the parent to be charged with a crime and adds that the vagueness of the statutes leave \"a lot of room for discretion by social workers, police, judges, and prosecutors, to determine which whose failures to supervise to pursue. This allows race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions in both the child welfare and criminal justice systems.\" Certainly those biases could be at play here: Harrell is black, and class is definitely behind how her situation came to be in the first place. As Jonathan Chait points out in New York magazine, when welfare reform was passed in the '90s, single mothers were pushed into low-paying, full-time work that did not provide enough income to afford child care. <doc_sep> 1 Parents ought to enjoy broad latitude in bringing up their children. There are obviously limits. The state ought to intervene if a child is being abused. But letting a 9-year-old go to the park alone does not come close to meeting that threshold. Honestly, it seems a bit young to me, but I do not know the kid or the neighborhood, it does not sound as though the mother had any great option, and as I did not give birth to the kid, support her, and raise her for 9 years, it is not my call. 2 By arresting this mom presumably causing her to lose her job and putting the child in foster care, the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park, whatever one thinks of the decision to leave her there. Even if the state felt it had the right to declare this parenting decision impermissible, could not they have given this woman a simple warning before taking custody? 3 The state's decision is coming at a time when it is suffering from a shortage of foster families, as well as a child protective services workforce so overwhelmed that serious child abuse inquiries are regularly closed in violation of policy. Perhaps most concerning of all are the surfeit of cases where child protective services censures parents for ostensibly jeopardizing a kid's safety in a manner that is totally disconnected from any statistical realities about the actual dangers faced. This point was made superbly in a Salon article written by a mother who was cited by police for leaving her kid in a car while briefly running into a store-even though it was not a hot day, she was gone for mere minutes, and the kid was in no danger. She relayed a conversation she later had with a Free Range Kids founder. \"Listen,\" she said at one point. \"Let us put aside for the moment that by far, the most dangerous thing you did to your child that day was put him in a car and drive someplace with him. About 300 children are injured in traffic accidents every day-and about two die. That is a real risk. So if you truly wanted to protect your kid, you would never drive anywhere with him. But let us put that aside. So you take him, and you get to the store where you need to run in for a minute and you are faced with a decision. Now, people will say you committed a crime because you put your kid 'at risk.' But the truth is, there is some risk to either decision you make.\" She stopped at this point to emphasize, as she does in much of her analysis, how shockingly rare the abduction or injury of children in non-moving, non-overheated vehicles really is. For example, she insists that statistically speaking, it would likely take 750,000 years for a child left alone in a public space to be snatched by a stranger. \"So there is some risk to leaving your kid in a car,\" she argues. It might not be statistically meaningful but it is not nonexistent. The problem is,\" she goes on, \"there is some risk to every choice you make. So, say you take the kid inside with you. There is some risk you will both be hit by a crazy driver in the parking lot. There is some risk someone in the store will go on a shooting spree and shoot your kid. There is some risk he will slip on the ice on the sidewalk outside the store and fracture his skull. There is some risk no matter what you do. So why is one choice illegal and one is OK? Could it be because the one choice inconveniences you, makes your life a little harder, makes parenting a little harder, gives you a little less time or energy than you would have otherwise had?\" Later on in the conversation, Skenazy boils it down to this. \"There is been this huge cultural shift. We now live in a society where most people believe a child can not be out of your sight for one second, where people think children need constant, total adult supervision. This shift is not rooted in fact. It is not rooted in any true change. It is imaginary. It is rooted in irrational fear.\" The cultural shift certainly does not seem to be rooted in empiricism. <doc_sep> Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Debra Lynn Harrell, 46, is charged with unlawful neglect toward a child, according to the North Augusta Department of Public Safety. Officers responded to a park on Old Edgefield Road around 2 p.m. Monday, according to an incident report. A woman told officers that a girl had been playing in the park since 9:30 a.m. with no adult supervision. The woman told officers that she asked the girl where her mother was and she told her that her mother dropped her off before going to work, according to the report. She also told the woman that her mother drops her off at the park all the time so she can play while her mother is at work. The girl also said that she sometimes walks over to the McDonald's inside Walmart to buy lunch, according to the report. Officers took the girl to police headquarters and contacted her mother. Harrell confessed to officers that she left her daughter alone at the park. She was arrested and booked into jail. The Department of Social Services took custody of the child. Copyright 2014 WFXG.

    "reference_summary": "Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail? Because that is what happened to Debra Harrell. The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it is been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law Order does not mean it is happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I am a parent, Harrell's arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude-and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped because the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America's primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they are taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there is no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined. State employees are drawing on their prejudices to make somewhat arbitrary judgment calls.\"",

    "document": "New York Times reporter James Risen is fighting back against critics who have cast a skeptical eye on his Page One story yesterday about Afghanistan's mineral deposits. In an interview with Yahoo! News, Risen dismissed suspicions that the story was part of an orchestrated campaign to rescue the troubled American effort there and derided critical bloggers as pajama-clad layabouts with no reporting chops. Risen's story reported the findings of ongoing Pentagon research into the value Afghanistan's lithium, copper, iron, and other mineral deposits, and cited officials claiming that \"the United States has discovered nearly 1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself.\" Risen's piece quickly drew fire from online reporters and writers including this one who pointed out that many of the story's purported revelations about Afghanistan's mineral reserves had been previously reported. They also questioned the timing of the story, coming as it did on the heels of a series of troubling reports about the stability of the Karzai government and one day before Gen. David Petraeus was scheduled to testify before Congress about the war. The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder wrote that the story \"suggest s a broad and deliberate information operation designed to influence public opinion on the course of the war.\" Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall wrote that \"the timing of the revelation is enough to raise some suspicions in my mind.\" And Foreign Policy's Blake Hounshell wrote that \"there is less to this scoop than meets the eye.\" Risen did not take kindly to the blogospheric criticism. \"Bloggers should do their own reporting instead of sitting around in their pajamas,\" Risen said. \"The thing that amazes me is that the blogosphere thinks they can deconstruct other people's stories,\" Risen told Yahoo! News during an increasingly hostile interview, which he called back to apologize for almost immediately after it ended. \"Do you even know anything about me? Maybe you were still in school when I broke the NSA story, I do not know. It was back when you were in kindergarten, I think.\" Risen and fellow Times reporter Eric Lichtblau shared a 2006 Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the Bush administration's secret wiretapping program; this reporter was 33 years old at the time. Risen defended the article against claims that Afghanistan's mineral wealth was largely a matter of public knowledge prior to his story. \"If it was not news, then why did not anybody write about it?\" he asked. In fact, McClatchy Newspapers reported last year that \"the region is thought to hold some of the world's last major untapped deposits of iron, copper, gold, uranium, precious gems and other raw materials.\" In February, Agence France Presse quoted Afghan president Hamid Karzai, citing a YOU.S. Geological Survey study, claiming that his country had 1 trillion in mineral assets. Just last month, Karzai repeated the claim at a YOU.S. Institute of Peace event, saying the value was between 1 trillion and 3 trillion. \"But no one picked up on it,\" Risen said. He explained that he based his report on the work of a Pentagon team led by Paul Brinkley, a deputy undersecretary of defense charged with rebuilding the Afghan economy. Using geological data from the Soviet era and USGS surveys conducted in 2006, Brinkley dispatched teams to Afghanistan last year to search for minerals on the ground. The data they have come back with, combined with internal Pentagon assessments that value the deposits at more than 900 billion, constitute news, according to Risen. Those surveys are still under way, according to a briefing Brinkley gave yesterday. \"The question is how extensive it was,\" Risen said of the survey work. \"The value of what Brinkley's team did was to put together and connect the dots on a lot of information that had been put on the shelf. And they did new research and came up with a lot of new data and put everything together in a more comprehensive way.\" So was the story a Pentagon plant, designed to show the American public a shiny metallic light at the end of the long tunnel that is the Afghan war, as skeptics allege? Risen said he heard about the Pentagon's efforts from Milt Bearden, a retired CIA officer who was active in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The men co-authored a book, \"The Main Enemy,\" in 2003, and Bearden is now a consultant working with Brinkley's survey team. \"Several months ago, Milt started telling me about what they were finding,\" Risen said. \"At the beginning of the year, I said I wanted to do a story on it.\" At first both Bearden and Brinkley resisted, Risen said, but he eventually wore them down. \"Milt convinced Brinkley to talk to me,\" he said, \"and Brinkley convinced other Pentagon officials to go on the record. I think Milt realized that things were going so badly in Afghanistan that people would be willing to talk about this.\" In other words, according to Risen, he was not handed the story in a calculated leak. Calls and emails to Brinkley and to Eric Clark, a Pentagon public relations contractor who works with him, were not immediately returned. Minutes after making his initial angry comments about bloggers, Risen called back to apologize. \"I was taken aback by some of the criticism, and did not sleep well last night, and was upset about it. I apologize.\" -John Cook is a senior national reporter blogger for Yahoo! News <doc_sep> ink-stained wretches Cranky Times Reporter Lashes Out at Critical Bloggers With many online news outlets wondering whether a New York Times story on Afghanistan's mineral deposits was less a fresh discovery than a PR ploy by the Army, the story's author, James Risen, let loose on the brash, ignorant youngsters who dare to question him. \"Do you even know anything about me?\" he asked Yahoo News blogger John Cook, late of Gawker. \"Maybe you were still in school when I broke the NSA story, I do not know. It was back when you were in kindergarten, I think.\" Cook also tweeted that Risen, falling back on hurtful stereotypes, said that bloggers who criticized the story were just \"jerking off in their pajamas.\" Ouch, man. Ouch. That just shows how little Risen actually understands bloggers. We would never jerk off in our only article of clothing. Shortly after hanging up, Risen regained his composure and called back. \"I was taken aback by some of the criticism, and did not sleep well last night, and was upset about it,\" he said. \"I apologize.\" Sounds like someone needs a nappy-poo. NYT reporter defends Afghan minerals piece, lashes out at critics Newsroom Yahoo <doc_sep> While it could take many years to develop a mining industry, the potential is so great that officials and executives in the industry believe it could attract heavy investment even before mines are profitable, providing the possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \"There is stunning potential here,\" Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview on Saturday. \"There are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is hugely significant.\" The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan's existing war-bedraggled economy, which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as aid from the United States and other industrialized countries. Afghanistan's gross domestic product is only about 12 billion. \"This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy,\" said Jalil Jumriany, an adviser to the Afghan minister of mines. American and Afghan officials agreed to discuss the mineral discoveries at a difficult moment in the war in Afghanistan. The American-led offensive in Marja in southern Afghanistan has achieved only limited gains. Meanwhile, charges of corruption and favoritism continue to plague the Karzai government, and Mr. Karzai seems increasingly embittered toward the White House. So the Obama administration is hungry for some positive news to come out of Afghanistan. Yet the American officials also recognize that the mineral discoveries will almost certainly have a double-edged impact. Instead of bringing peace, the newfound mineral wealth could lead the Taliban to battle even more fiercely to regain control of the country. The corruption that is already rampant in the Karzai government could also be amplified by the new wealth, particularly if a handful of well-connected oligarchs, some with personal ties to the president, gain control of the resources. Just last year, Afghanistan's minister of mines was accused by American officials of accepting a 30 million bribe to award China the rights to develop its copper mine. The minister has since been replaced. Endless fights could erupt between the central government in Kabul and provincial and tribal leaders in mineral-rich districts. Afghanistan has a national mining law, written with the help of advisers from the World Bank, but it has never faced a serious challenge. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \"No one has tested that law; no one knows how it will stand up in a fight between the central government and the provinces,\" observed Paul A. Brinkley, deputy undersecretary of defense for business and leader of the Pentagon team that discovered the deposits. At the same time, American officials fear resource-hungry China will try to dominate the development of Afghanistan's mineral wealth, which could upset the United States, given its heavy investment in the region. After winning the bid for its Aynak copper mine in Logar Province, China clearly wants more, American officials said. Another complication is that because Afghanistan has never had much heavy industry before, it has little or no history of environmental protection either. \"The big question is, can this be developed in a responsible way, in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible?\" Mr. Brinkley said. \"No one knows how this will work.\" With virtually no mining industry or infrastructure in place today, it will take decades for Afghanistan to exploit its mineral wealth fully. \"This is a country that has no mining culture,\" said Jack Medlin, a geologist in the United States Geological Survey's international affairs program. \"They have had some small artisanal mines, but now there could be some very, very large mines that will require more than just a gold pan.\" Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you are not a robot by clicking the box.

The mineral deposits are scattered throughout the country, including in the southern and eastern regions along the border with Pakistan that have had some of the most intense combat in the American-led war against the Taliban insurgency. The Pentagon task force has already started trying to help the Afghans set up a system to deal with mineral development. International accounting firms that have expertise in mining contracts have been hired to consult with the Afghan Ministry of Mines, and technical data is being prepared to turn over to multinational mining companies and other potential foreign investors. The Pentagon is helping Afghan officials arrange to start seeking bids on mineral rights by next fall, officials said. \"The Ministry of Mines is not ready to handle this,\" Mr. Brinkley said. \"We are trying to help them get ready.\" Like much of the recent history of the country, the story of the discovery of Afghanistan's mineral wealth is one of missed opportunities and the distractions of war. In 2004, American geologists, sent to Afghanistan as part of a broader reconstruction effort, stumbled across an intriguing series of old charts and data at the library of the Afghan Geological Survey in Kabul that hinted at major mineral deposits in the country. They soon learned that the data had been collected by Soviet mining experts during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, but cast aside when the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the chaos of the 1990s, when Afghanistan was mired in civil war and later ruled by the Taliban, a small group of Afghan geologists protected the charts by taking them home, and returned them to the Geological Survey's library only after the American invasion and the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. \"There were maps, but the development did not take place, because you had 30 to 35 years of war,\" said Ahmad Hujabre, an Afghan engineer who worked for the Ministry of Mines in the 1970s. Armed with the old Russian charts, the United States Geological Survey began a series of aerial surveys of Afghanistan's mineral resources in 2006, using advanced gravity and magnetic measuring equipment attached to an old Navy Orion P-3 aircraft that flew over about 70 percent of the country. The data from those flights was so promising that in 2007, the geologists returned for an even more sophisticated study, using an old British bomber equipped with instruments that offered a three-dimensional profile of mineral deposits below the earth's surface. It was the most comprehensive geologic survey of Afghanistan ever conducted. The handful of American geologists who pored over the new data said the results were astonishing. But the results gathered dust for two more years, ignored by officials in both the American and Afghan governments. In 2009, a Pentagon task force that had created business development programs in Iraq was transferred to Afghanistan, and came upon the geological data. Until then, no one besides the geologists had bothered to look at the information and no one had sought to translate the technical data to measure the potential economic value of the mineral deposits. Soon, the Pentagon business development task force brought in teams of American mining experts to validate the survey's findings, and then briefed Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Mr. Karzai. So far, the biggest mineral deposits discovered are of iron and copper, and the quantities are large enough to make Afghanistan a major world producer of both, United States officials said. Other finds include large deposits of niobium, a soft metal used in producing superconducting steel, rare earth elements and large gold deposits in Pashtun areas of southern Afghanistan. Just this month, American geologists working with the Pentagon team have been conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan where they believe there are large deposits of lithium. Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large of those of Bolivia, which now has the world's largest known lithium reserves. For the geologists who are now scouring some of the most remote stretches of Afghanistan to complete the technical studies necessary before the international bidding process is begun, there is a growing sense that they are in the midst of one of the great discoveries of their careers.

    "document": "The Washington media loves Mitch McConnell as a creature of the establishment and hates Donald Trump with a burning passion. So the Washington media has a vested interest in savaging Donald Trump for Luther Strange's loss, while protecting Mitch McConnell. But ask any Roy Moore voter and you will find that they believed Donald Trump really wanted Moore, not Strange, in the Senate. They believe, rightly, that Trump was just going through the motions with Strange. Trump was trying to play nice with the establishment in hopes they might get their butts in gear on Obamacare. But he had no real affinity for Luther Strange. His rhetoric was all in Roy Moore's wheelhouse. McConnell poured money into the race for Strange and even blessed Luther Strange deciding at the last minute to start campaigning against Mitch McConnell. Moore made running against McConnell the theme of his campaign. Both sides claimed they were going to help Trump against McConnell, but Moore's base really believed him. Strange's was just going through the motions. It is harder and harder to get honest reporting from DC when it comes to Trump. Reporters just hate him so much. So the DC press corps is celebrating the Roy Moore win as a Trump defeat when the reality and truth are that Moore is the most Trumpian senate candidate in America today. His race is not over, but the Democrats will mount little credible opposition. And when Donald Trump comes back to campaign for Roy Moore, Moore's base will know Trump means it this time. <doc_sep> For Mitch McConnell, Tuesday was about as bad as it could get. A vulnerable incumbent senator, Luther Strange of Alabama, lost handily to Roy Moore, who used the Senate leader as his campaign punching bag. McConnell pulled the plug again on repealing Obamacare. One of his close allies, Sen. Bob Corker R-Tenn. announced his retirement. Story Continued Below And President Donald Trump is back on McConnell's case, dubbing him \"weak\" at a private dinner with conservative activists on Monday evening. McConnell's job is in no immediate danger, and he hopes to pivot quickly to tax reform. Yet months of woes are now taking their toll on the GOP leader's agenda, and his caucus. \"It is been a hard summer for all of us,\" admitted Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP senator. Asked Tuesday whether he was having a \"tough day,\" McConnell ignored the question. And that was before Corker announced his retirement and Moore won. \"We have not given up on changing the American health care system,\" McConnell said. \"We are not going to be able to do that this week, but it still lies ahead of us, and we have not given up on that.\" McConnell's long-shot bid to save Strange, who had Trump's backing as well, failed spectacularly as the former Alabama attorney general was trounced by Moore in the deep red state. And that soon could be a daily problem for McConnell. Moore, twice ousted as a judge on the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal edicts, has openly said he wants to dump McConnell as the top Senate Republican. \"Judge Roy Moore in the YOU.S. Senate means the END of Mitch McConnell's reign as Majority Leader,\" Moore vowed in one fundraising pitch. Moore now faces Democrat Doug Jones in the December 12 general election. Moore's win came just hours after McConnell, faced with unwavering opposition from a trio of his GOP colleagues, was forced to ditch the latest GOP proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Yet it was another embarrassing setback in McConnell's failed months-long effort to overturn the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and it came at an even heavier price this time more problems for McConnell from the occupant of the Oval Office. Trump spent much of August publicly bashing McConnell but stopped after the two held a private meeting several weeks ago. But now the president is bad-mouthing the Senate leader again. During a dinner with conservative activists on Monday night at the White House, Trump laid into McConnell, according to two attendees. Trump told the activists that McConnell was \"weak\" because he could not pass the GOP health care plan, and the president complained at length about how Republicans had failed him on the issue, while asking the activists what they should do next. Trump added that he was disappointed in McConnell for not changing the Senate filibuster rule so that only 51 votes are needed to pass legislation, also dubbing McConnell's resistance to the idea as \"weak.\" That criticism does not ring true to Senate Republicans, given that Democrats have barely been able to use the filibuster due to McConnell mostly holding party-line votes. A McConnell spokesman declined to comment. A person briefed on the meeting noted Trump took aim at far more than McConnell during the meeting, distancing himself from Strange and whacking Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. as well. Trump called McCain \"disgraceful\" on health care and mocked his thumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor against a GOP proposal in July, complete with a facial expression, attendees said. After the race was called Tuesday, McConnell vowed to support Moore in the general election despite the candidate's opposition to him personally. \"He ran a spirited campaign centered around a dissatisfaction with the progress made in Washington. I share that frustration,\" McConnell said of Moore in a statement. \"Senate Republicans will be as committed to keeping Alabama's Senate seat in Republican hands with Roy Moore as we were with Luther Strange.\" McConnell's support in the Republican Conference remains solid despite what Trump, Moore and former Trump aide Steve Bannon say about him. Bannon has launched a crusade against the Senate leader and Speaker Paul Ryan R-Ohio since leaving the White House. \"It is not even a close question there,\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said of McConnell's position. \"It is not easy being majority leader, which is why many people choose not to run for it.\" The way to put an end to anti-McConnell challengers, Cornyn said, is \"you win. Really, it is about that simple.\" After ushering through the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, McConnell has found himself in a box. Trump will receive the lion's share of credit for legislative victories that McConnell or Ryan engineer, but the president has made clear he will blame the GOP leaders when bills falter. Trump might turn to Democrats again in search of victories as he did earlier this month to put off a fight over the budget and debt ceiling which would again test McConnell and Ryan's loyalty to the president. Some Republicans said that at least in the case of Obamacare, McConnell was not to blame for the failure of the proposal pushed by Sens. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. and Bill Cassidy R-La. \"The whole health care thing right now was sort of inspired by Graham and Cassidy, and the president, who kept it alive. I do not think Mitch has much ownership other than to try to see if there is a path forward,\" Thune said. Thune added that Strange's situation in Alabama was a \"unique set of circumstances. I think everybody in a lot of these places, particularly primary voters, want to send a message to Washington.\" Strange was appointed to the seat by former Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, who later resigned in a sex scandal. Strange's appointment did not sit well with Alabama voters. The Senate Leadership Fund, a pro-McConnell super PAC, dumped 9 million into the race in a bid to derail Moore, but he proved far too strong. And Trump's endorsement of Strange proved to be too little, too late. \"What happens today in Alabama with Luther Strange has nothing to do with Mitch McConnell. It has everything to do with Alabama,\" Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said before the results were tallied. Personal loyalty to McConnell remains high among his colleagues. They remember him as a two-term chairman of the NRSC. He led the fight against former President Barack Obama for eight years. And he got Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court, which is Trump's only real win in Congress so far. When it comes to who to blame for a difficult year with just a 52-seat majority, McConnell's colleagues refuse to point to the majority leader as the source of the problem. They criticize each other, not McConnell. \"You can only fight with the troops that you have got,\" Sen. Roy Blunt R-Mo. said of McConnell's predicament. <doc_sep> Why it matters: A funding freeze could be seen as a slap against the organization which the YOU.S. and Israel consider to be biased against Israel and too politicized and an attempt to pressure the Palestinians to return to peace talks with Israel. But a State Department official said that the fact the money was not transferred on January 1 does not mean it was frozen. \"There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,\" the official said. The Trump administration has frozen 125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual YOU.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by January 1 but was withheld. The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of YOU.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the YOU.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway \"in light of the Palestinians' recent conduct.\" The diplomats added that YOU.S. officials told YOU.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to 180 million, which amounts to half of the YOU.S. funding to UNRWA. The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the YOU.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. YOU.N. secretary general Antnio Guterres has spoken with senior YOU.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of YOU.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,\" a senior Israeli security official told me. What we are hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of YOU.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he cannot be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. Officials in the prime minister's office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of YOU.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the YOU.S. does not cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers \"gradual disengagement\" with UNRWA by the YOU.S. and not a big funding cut. The prime minister's office said in a statement: \"Netanyahu supports President Trump's critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.\"",
    "reference_summary": "As has been widely noted, Mitch McConnell had a truly awful Tuesday. The Senate majority leader had to surrender on ObamaCare repeal, ally Bob Corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the Senate candidate that McConnell strongly backed in Alabama got trounced by one backed by the Steve Bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for McConnell? Here is a look at coverage: Mocked by Trump: The president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered McConnell, reports Axios. Trump also reportedly called out McConnell as \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports Politico. On the wane: McConnell has gone from \"brilliant tactician\" to looking vulnerable after the defeats this week, reports the New York Times. If the GOP fails to get tax reform passed this year, his post as majority leader could be in jeopardy-especially with populist insurgents backed by Bannon looking to win more seats. No immediate danger: Both Politico and the Times say McConnell retains rock-solid support in the Republican Conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of Senate Republicans. Beware the midterms: In a piece subtitled, \"Is the Senate Leader Losing His Grip on the GOP?,\" Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \"With the GOP in the midst of an ideological schism, McConnell's faction could be headed for a reckoning.\" Indeed, Tuesday's triple whammy \"just shows how weak the Republican establishment is right now,\" writes Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. Boehner's fate? McConnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the ObamaCare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file Republicans, per an analysis at the Washington Post. \"But one thing that could hamper McConnell's long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead,\" writes Paul Kane. Fear of that played a role in John Boehner's resignation as House speaker two years ago. False narrative: Many in the media are portraying the Alabama results as a loss for Trump, but winner Roy Moore is decidedly Trumpian, writes Erick Erickson at the Resurgent. No, this was all about McConnell-in fact, Moore made running against him \"the theme of his campaign.\"",

    "document": "John Heath in the Danbury Superior Court House for Heath's arraignment on a murder charge for the death of Heath's wife, Elizabeth, 28 years ago in Newtown. The husband of a woman whose body was found inside a well under a barn in Newtown pleaded not guilty to a murder charge on Tuesday and is being held on 1 million bond. John Heath, 68, of Bridgewater, was charged with the murder of his wife, Elizabeth Gough Heath,on Monday. He appeared in court wearing oxygen tubes, the News-Times reports. Heath, whose daughter lives in Puerto Rico, according to the News-Times, was ordered to hand in his passport. Prosecutors said officials acted quickly to arrest Heath after a moving truck was spotted at his house over the weekend. Elizabeth Gough Heath was reported missing in April 1984, just days after John Heath filed for divorce. She was 30 years old at the time. John Heath reported his wife missing on April 6, 1984. According to court records, he told police she took off with 600 cash, but told several friends she left with no money. A father and son found Elizabeth Gough Heath's remains in April 2010 as they were renovating the barn at 89 Poverty Hallow Road. They were working on breaking through badly damaged flooring when they found a covered well. Inside were pillows, a blanket, a pillow case and a bag containing what looked like a human femur. Elizabeth had been wrapped in bedding and placed head-first into the hole in the barn with a plastic bag covering her skull, according to court records. When police questioned John Heath, he said he renovated the barn in 1990 and used a jackhammer to open hole in floor to put a cast iron pipe under concrete, according to information from court. During the renovation, a relative asked him about what was under a concrete lid in the barn and he said it was an old septic tank and to leave it alone. When police told John Heath that Elizabeth had a broken forearm and the bone was smashed, Heath said \"Smashed like a.\" He did not finish the sentence but raised and lowered his hands as he said \"smashed\" as if he was holding something, according to court records. The medical examiner previously ruled Elizabeth's death a homicide. She died from four blows to the head, the medical examiner determined. Her left arm was broken, which authorities said was consistent with a defensive wound, and there was a traumatic amputation of her maxilla. Land records show that John Heath owned the property until 2005, when he lost the property to foreclosure. John Heath's friends said he was a Vietnam Veteran with a volatile temper and still very disturbed by what he encountered in Vietnam.

Photo: Contributed Photo Erin Cox Image 1 of 28 Caption Close Heath pleads not guilty in wife's death 1 28 Back to Gallery DANBURY -Twenty-eight years after telling police she had abandoned him and their 4-year-old daughter in the middle of the night, John Heath pleaded not guilty in state Superior Court on Tuesday morning to the crime friends and family members say they have long suspected he committed, the 1984 murder of his wife at their Poverty Hollow Road home in Newtown. The 68-year-old, retired painting contractor was taken into custody by Newtown Police on Monday evening, two years after Elizabeth Heath's remains were found wrapped in bedclothes and stuffed head-first into a cistern beneath the floor of a former dairy barn the new property owner was renovating. Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe said Tuesday that investigators obtained the arrest warrant for Heath late Monday afternoon, and eventually found him driving on Hannibal Road in Newtown. \"Obviously, we are pleased,\" Kehoe said Tuesday. \"It is been an exhaustive investigation.\" Breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank and wearing a gray, hooded sweatshirt, Heath was arraigned before Judge John Blawie, who rejected a request by his interim attorney, Public Defender Miles Gerety, to reduce the 1 million bond set when Heath was arrested. More Information About John Heath Age: 68 Town: Bridgewater Charge: Murder of wife Elizabeth, in Newtown, on or about April 1, 1984 Bond: 1 million State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky said the arrest warrant was issued after authorities were tipped about a moving truck outside Heath's rented home in Bridgewater over the weekend. Heath, his wife, Raquel, and their two children moved there after losing the Newtown property to foreclosure in 2005, triggering the sequence of events that led to the discovery of Elizabeth Heath's body in April 2010. Blawie also ordered Heath to surrender his passport. Gerety declined to comment after the brief hearing, as did Raquel Heath when she was besieged by reporters as she was leaving the courthouse. After repeatedly responding to questions with, \"No comment, no comment,\" she eventually asked one television reporter, Do you want me to sing it to you?\" For years, John Heath told family members and friends that his 32-year-old wife had vanished without explanation as he slept, leaving behind their daughter, her dogs, car and most of her belongings. The couple were in the process of getting a divorce, but numerous people interviewed told investigators they had doubts about John Heath's story, and they said Elizabeth Heath would never have abandoned her daughter. One former neighbor told investigators that Heath's daughter, Meghann, was \"joined to her at the hip,\" police said in the warrant. John Heath obtained the divorce in August 1984 and he married his current wife, who had been a friend of Elizabeth's and a babysitter for their daughter, the following June. The 30-page arrest warrant affidavit includes, almost verbatim, many of the interviews police conducted during the lengthy investigation, shedding light on the couple's faltering, nearly six-year marriage and laying bare the suspicions of the couple's friends, neighbors and members of John Heath's family that he was responsible for her disappearance. Even John Heath's own mother, who has since died, believed \"something was not right, I know John did something to her,\" Elizabeth Heath's sister-in-law, Debbie Lewis, told investigators. Lewis, who was married to John Heath's half-brother, said Elizabeth told her, \"If anything happens to me, you know that John did it,\" according to the warrant. Detectives also cited inconsistencies in the story John Heath told after Elizabeth disappeared, and quoted one of his current wife's cousins about Heath's response when the cousin asked what was beneath the hatchway in the barn floor while they were building a basement apartment in 1996. \"Heath stated it was septic and leave it alone,\" police quoted the cousin, Robert Rivera. But most of the information contained in the lengthy document appears to be circumstantial, thin on the kind of forensic evidence that would conclusively tie a suspect to a crime. Much of the potential forensic evidence had degraded over the years that the body lay hidden, making it impossible to recover DNA, Kehoe said. \"Time and environmental factors had a definite effect on what we could do,\" the chief said. \"What we have is a totality of the circumstances. You want to ask the question, Where did this young lady go and why would she leave her child?'\" An autopsy determined that Elizabeth Heath died of multiple blows to the head. She also suffered a broken arm, consistent with a defensive wound, according to the affidavit. Blawie continued the case to May 16, allowing time for the appointment of a special public defender for Heath, Sedensky said. Gerety can no longer continue to represent Heath because members of his staff had been police officers in Newtown, creating a conflict of interests, the prosecutor said. Blawie set June 19 as the tentative date for a probable because hearing in the case. jpirro newstimes.com; 203-731-3342",

    "document": "If the tech world had an All-Star Game, today's Internet Forum at Microsoft could certainly qualify. Top CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alibaba's Jack Ma, and 23 other executives gathered today in Redmond, Wash., to meet with China President Xi Jinping at the conclusion of the eighth annual YOU.S.-China Internet Industry Forum. It was a rare gathering of some of the most powerful people in the tech industry who traveled from across the globe to Microsoft's campus this week. Before posing for a group picture and making a few remarks, the president and first lady Peng Liyuan joined Nadella, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and others at the company's executive building for a short tour that included technology demos of Microsoft products like the HoloLens and data visualization software. President Xi then made his way to a large room to meet the CEOs, many of whom already spoke with China's leader at a roundtable meeting earlier Wednesday. He went down the first line and shook hands with people like Zuckerberg, who spent 30 seconds delivering a message in Chinese to the president the Facebook founder knows the language pretty well before taking the podium for a quick speech. \"On a personal note, this was the first time I have ever spoken with a world leader entirely in a foreign language,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook, which is banned in China. \"I consider that a meaningful personal milestone. It was an honor to meet President Xi and other leaders.\" \"We are at Microsoft, while in the morning, I visited Boeing, which is hardware,\" President Xi told the CEOs. \"So, we have had both the hard things and the soft things.\" Presdient Xi, who is in the Seattle region this week meeting with business executives and government officials before heading to Washington D.C. to see President Obama, said he was impressed with the \"beautiful campus of Microsoft.\" He also noted that 2015 marked the 20th anniversary of cooperation between Microsoft and China. \"Microsoft products and the Windows operating system have shaped man's cognition of computing technologies,\" said the president, who was accompanied by a large delegation that included China's \"Internet czar\" Lu Wei. Unsurprisingly, President Xi touched on cybersecurity, a topic that is caused tension between the YOU.S. and Chinese governments as of late with tech-related policies and technology protectionism. \"China advocates the building of a peaceful, secure, open, and cooperative cyberspace and believes that countries should formulate Internet-related public policies in line with their respective national realities,\" he said. The president noted that China has the world's largest Internet market, while the YOU.S. boasts the \"most-advanced Internet technologies.\" \"The two sides should, on the basis of mutual respect, carry out constructive dialogue on cyber issues and forge a new highlight of China-YOU.S. cooperation so that cyberspace will provide more benefits to the people of both countries, as well as people of the whole world,\" he said. Here are the CEOs that attended, starting with the top row in this picture any guesses at the net worth in this room? Top row: Sugon CEO Li Jun; Didi-Kuaidi CEO Cheng Wei; Broadband Capital CEO Tian Suning; CEC CEO Liu Liehong; Baidu CEO Zhang Yaqin; AME Cloud Ventures CEO Jerry Yang; Inspur CEO Sun Pishu; Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky; Sequoia Capital China founder Shen Nanpeng.

Bottom row: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; JD.com CEO Liu Qiangdong; Cisco Chairman John Chambers; Alibaba founder Jack Ma; IBM CEO Ginni Rometty; President Xi; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; China Minister Lu Wei; Apple CEO Tim Cook; Tencent CEO Pony Ma; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. <doc_sep> Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has gushed about his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, calling it a \"personal milestone\", after he spoke in Mandarin to Xi at an event on Wednesday. \"On a personal note, this was the first time I have ever spoken with a world leader entirely in a foreign language,\" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page about the conversation that lasted less than a minute. \"I consider that a meaningful personal milestone.\" A picture accompanying the post showed Zuckerberg greeting the president. He was in a suit and tie a rare practice for the internet billionaire. Lu Wei China's internet tsar, who controls the country's great firewall that blocks Facebook among other foreign websites stood by the two, wearing a broad smile. \"It was an honour to meet President Xi and other leaders,\" Zuckerberg's post read, adding that internet users could follow updates of the president's first state visit to the United States on the Facebook page \"Xi's US Visit\". Zuckerberg met Xi when the president visited Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, near Seattle, on Wednesday. A Microsoft spokeswoman said that during Xi's meeting there with internet CEOs, the president spoke for only about six minutes and that none of the American business leaders responded. Zuckerberg's post about his brief chat with Xi sparked debate among internet users over China's censorship. \"He has already banned your Facebook in China Why did you meet him,\" one user commented. This is not the first time the Facebook founder has shown his admiration for the Chinese president. When he welcomed Lu Wei on a visit to his company's headquarters in December, press photos showed a copy of The Governance of China a collection of Xi's speeches on Zuckerberg's desk. The gesture, interpreted as Zuckerberg's effort to court the Chinese government, disappointed and angered activists in China, who had held the social network in high regard for sharing information beyond the tight controls of the country's ruling Communist Party, the Associated Press reported. \"Mr Zuckerberg is either ignorant of China's politics or shameless,\" said prominent dissident Hu Jia, who called Lu a top enemy of internet freedom and expressed worry that technology giants such as Facebook were kowtowing to Beijing for their own business interests. \"He is an internet genius who should understand the power of technology for social change.\" Asked in November about Facebook's blockage in China, Lu said: \"The bottom line for foreign internet companies to enter China is they obey Chinese laws and regulations.\" They should not harm the country's national interest and the interest of Chinese consumers, the top internet regulator added. <doc_sep> After his appearances at the United Nations and a six-day, cross-country journey, President Xi Jinping headed home on Monday. Looking back at the trip, the most memorable moment and maybe the most important was watching 2.5 trillion of American corporate power pay homage to the Chinese president. That event unfolded in a less than obvious way. When word circulated that the chief executives of the top American technology companies would meet with Mr. Xi for a group photo on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., last week, many wondered who would turn up. The photo was scheduled for the end of an Internet industry conference that the Chinese had choreographed for Mr. Xi's trip to try to smooth over the deep problems many American tech companies face in the China market, including rampant theft of intellectual property. For days, reporters had asked Microsoft, a co-host of the conference with China, for the names of the executive who would meet Mr. Xi. Microsoft demurred. The turnout at the opening session of the conference was desultory. Perhaps, it seemed, there would just be a handful of executives with Mr. Xi. In the afternoon, about 20 minutes before Mr. Xi was scheduled to arrive, his Internet czar, Lu Wei, entered the room where risers had been set up for the executives. Mr. Lu checked where Mr. Xi would stand, looked around the room, and left. Suddenly, the chief executives of America's top 10 technology companies market value about 2.5 trillion accompanied by the heads of more than a dozen Chinese tech companies, arrived. They lined up in three rows. These executives are not accustomed to being beckoned they turn down invitations to business summits, the World Economic Forum and more. But Mr. Xi beckoned, and they came. The allure of being in Mr. Xi's orbit was clearly too tantalizing for the executives to miss. After they arrived, the executives cooled their heels for more than 10 minutes, waiting for Mr. Xi to finish his tour of Microsoft. It was hard to imagine these execs waiting idly for 10 minutes anywhere else. Mr. Xi eventually entered, smiled and shook hands with the first row, starting with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, which is banned in China. For the photo, Mr. Xi planted himself next to Virginia M. Rometty, the head of IBM. A podium was rolled out, and Mr. Xi spoke for about six minutes, then left. That photo op turned out to be the most sensational moment of the trip, a 10-minute session that illustrated the raw power of the Chinese leader and the huge market he controls. Afterward, even Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said he was impressed. \"Did you feel the room shake?\" he said, with a smile. <doc_sep> Chinese president Xi Jinping got a warm welcome from tech leaders Wednesday Sept. 23 for his US tour. Some of the biggest names in tech-including Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg-met with the president for a discussion held in Seattle, where Xi is having a series of high-level meetings. To commemorate the occasion, the invited attendees-US and Chinese CEOs spanning multiple industries-posed for what can be described as an awkward class photo of super powerful people. Seattle Times reporter Matt Day tweeted the following image, taken at Microsoft's headquarters that is one way to get Cook to step foot into Microsoft's HQ In addition to Cook, Bezos, and Zuckerberg who apparently does own a suit some of the notable tech leaders in the photo include:",

LAPD detectives found materials inside the man's minivan that could have been used to set fires, the sources said. All the sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. FULL COVERAGE: Arson fires Little is known about the suspect. Sources said the minivan had Canadian license plates but that detectives say the man is from Germany. The man was detained near a drugstore at the corner of Fairfax Avenue and Sunset Boulevard early Monday morning, according to a witness to the incident. Several sources said the man is believed to be the same person seen in a surveillance video released by police Sunday, when authorities pointed to the individual as a \"person of interest\" in the case. <doc_sep> When the man police have identified as a \"person of interest\" in Los Angeles' spate of recent arson attacks was sitting in the back of a squad car early Monday morning, a small group of witnesses gave him \"the finger\"- and he returned the gesture with a smile, one witness said. \"It was creepy,\" said Rick Savage, a music producer who saw the incident at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Savage said he was awake because he has been nervous about the string of arsons in recent days in his and other nearby neighborhoods. He said he had downloaded a police scanner application onto his iPad and went to the area at about 3:15 a.m. after hearing reports that authorities had tracked a person of interest in the case. MAP: Arson fires \"For the past three nights, it is been freaking me out,\" Savage said of the fires. Aaron Arellano, who works the graveyard shift at a gas station across from where authorities stopped a blue minivan with the man inside, said that at first there were only three squad cars near the minivan. Then \"little by little\" more police and fire vehicles arrived until there was a mass of about two dozen on Sunset Boulevard, said the 28-year-old Arrelano. He said police officers some of whom came into the gas station for coffee told him they had caught \"one of the arsonists.\" PHOTOS: Arson fires Earlier Monday morning, police had stationed patrol cars throughout the affected areas and for a while set up checkpoints at some intersections. There were so many patrol cars and officers involved in the hunt that at one point Monday morning there were more than a dozen squad cars from the LAPD's Central Division on Ventura Boulevard, called in for additional help. The cars were stopped near one of the recent fires that had destroyed a car parked outside a single-family home on Sunnyslope Avenue in Sherman Oaks.

The California Highway Patrol spokesperson told KOIN 6 News that the vehicle a 2003 GMC SUV came to a stop 70-feet from the edge- approximately 5 feet off the highway before it accelerated and plunged off the cliff. \"It was pure acceleration from last break application until it hit the bottom of the ocean the edge of the ocean,\" said Greg Baarts with CHP.

KOIN Jennifer and Sarah recently moved to Woodland with their children from West Linn, where they had lived since 2014. In 2010 when they lived in Minnesota, Sarah Hart was arrested and later convicted of a gross misdemeanor for hitting one of the children, who was 6 at the time. She served a year on probation. The court documents revealed a teacher noticed bruises on the child's back and stomach after the child said her mom had hit her. She also said her mom would not give them lunch when they were grounded. In talking with police, Sarah Hart said the kids always got food but admitted spanking her daughter the day before and that it got out of control. The police report said \"that her mom had put her in the bathtub and turned on cold water and then hit her.also stated that her mom had hit her with a fist. When asked what she had done to make her mom mad, the child said that she had a penny in her pocket and that this made her mom mad.\" Detective Sgt. Larry Dailey of the Alexandria, Minnesota police told KOIN 6 News the Harts talked with the police on their own accord but left him with the impression they thought there was a lot being made over just regular parental discipline.

The search continued Wednesday for three missing children of the family whose car plunged off a California cliff last week, as investigators came closer to piecing together a timeline of their final days. The California Highway Patrol released a surveillance image from a Safeway in Fort Bragg taken March 25 a day before the Hart family's SUV was found crashed at the bottom of a rocky shoreline about 15 miles to the north. Authorities have said no skid marks were found at the top of the dirt turnout where the GMC Yukon pulled off, and believe the crash may have been intentional. The surveillance photo shows mom Jennifer Hart, 38, purchasing bananas and other groceries. It is unclear where her wife, Sarah, also 38, and their six adopted children were at the time. A surveillance photo shows Jennifer Hart, right, at the Safeway in Fort Bragg, California on March 25, 2018. California Highway Patrol The CHP said in a news release it was analyzing the store's footage with FBI agents in an attempt to enhance the blurry viewing quality. The investigation has included interviewing neighbors and searching the family's home in Woodland, Washington, about 25 miles north of Portland, Oregon. Based on the surveillance footage as well as cellphone pings, police have come up with the family's travel itinerary: They were south of Portland at around 8:15 a.m. local time on March 24, then continued moving south along a coastal route, crossing into Northern California. By 8 p.m., they were in the Fort Bragg area. They remained there until about 9 p.m. the next day. At some point, they decided to venture north along Highway 1. And on March 26, just after 3:30 p.m., a passerby called police about an upside down SUV that had fallen 70 feet to the embankment below. <doc_sep> FILE This March 20, 2016, file photo shows Hart family of Woodland, Wash., at a Bernie Sanders rally in Vancouver, Wash.

Associated Press FILE This March 20, 2016, file photo shows Hart family of Woodland, Wash., at a Bernie Sanders rally in Vancouver, Wash. The SUV carrying the Hart family accelerated straight off a scenic California cliff and authorities said the deadly wreck may have been intentional. Tristan Fortsch KATU News via. Associated Press SEATTLE AP A woman said Tuesday that she told Oregon child welfare officials in 2013 that Jennifer and Sarah Hart who plunged off a California cliff with their children last month in an SUV had been depriving the kids of food as punishment. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Alexandra Argyropoulos, a former friend of the Harts, said she \"witnessed what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment\" toward the six children. Argyropoulos said she was told after she made the report that Oregon officials had interviewed the children but it was apparent that each child had been coached by their mothers on what to say. She said she was told there was nothing more the Oregon Department of Human Services could do because there was not enough evidence to make a case. \"My heart is completely broken. The current system failed to protect these children from their abusers,\" Argyropoulos said. Authorities have said social services officials in Oregon contacted the West Linn Police Department about the family in 2013 while they were living in the area. Police referred media questions to the Oregon Department of Human Services, which cited privacy laws in refusing to say whether the agency was involved. Authorities do not know exactly when the wreck took place. A passing motorist discovered the vehicle on March 26, three days after social service authorities in Washington state opened an investigation apparently prompted by a neighbor's complaint that the children were being deprived of food. The Hart family's two moms and three of the six adopted children were found dead; the three others are missing and presumed dead, possibly washed out to sea. Authorities are investigating whether a surveillance video from Fort Bragg, California, shows one of the women a day before the SUV was found. California Highway Patrol investigators are working with the FBI to try to enhance the video. Later Tuesday, the highway patrol said investigators believe the Hart family was in or around Newport, Oregon, at about 8:15 a.m. March 24 and that they continued traveling south until reaching the area of Fort Bragg, California that evening. The family stayed in that area until the next evening, the state patrol said, officials said. The SUV carrying the family plummeted 100 feet 31 meters from a highway near Mendocino, California. On Sunday, authorities disclosed that data from the vehicle's software suggested the crash was deliberate. They said the SUV had stopped at a pull-off area before speeding straight off the cliff. Sarah Hart pleaded guilty in 2011 to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota over what she said was a spanking given to one of her children. Argyropoulos said she was unaware of a 2011 domestic assault conviction against Sarah Hart. She said she had met the couple on Facebook, knew them for about eight months and that the family visited her in the Bay Area twice. The couple broke off contact with her after she voiced concerns to them about their treatment of the children, she said. Two weeks ago, Bruce and Dana DeKalb, next-door neighbors of the Harts in Woodland, Washington, called state Child Protective Services because the couple's 15-year-old son Devonte had been coming over to their house almost every day for a week, asking for food. Dana DeKalb said Devonte told her his parents were \"punishing them by withholding food.\" The boy asked her to leave food in a box by the fence for him, she said. Devonte, a black boy who is still missing, drew national attention after he was photographed in tears while hugging a white police officer during a 2014 protest. <doc_sep> A surveillance video that appears to show one of the Hart mothers is being reviewed as a possible clue in deciphering the route the eight family members took and in the search of the three children who were reported missing but presumed dead after their SUV plunged off a California cliff last week. Authorities have spent days retracing the \"Hart Tribe's\" steps since the family's battered SUV was found overturned at the bottom of a cliff just off the Pacific Coast Highway, about 150 miles north of San Francisco. The investigation found the family of eight was believed to be in the Newport, Ore. area around 8:15 a.m. on March 24, two days before their vehicle was found, California Highway Patrol said in a Wednesday news release. \"It is believed they continued south along US 101 until they reached State Route 1 in Leggett, California. The family traveled south along State Route 1 until they reached the Fort Bragg area in Mendocino County around 8:00pm on Saturday evening, March 24, 2018,\" the news release read. WHERE ARE THE HART CHILDREN? INVESTIGATORS RETRACE ROUTE OF DOOMED FAMILY WHO PLUNGED OFF CLIFF A map released by California Highway Patrol showed the coastal route the family possibly took. Authorities retraced the route based on cellphone pings, Officer Cal Robertson told Oregon Live. Police said the route goes cold, however, by Sunday night. A surveillance video taken just after 8 a.m. at a Safeway in Fort Bragg appeared to show Jennifer Hart at the register buying bananas and several other items. It is unclear where the Harts went after the incident. Initial reports said there were signs that suggested the family planned for a short trip. Their SUV, a 2003 GMC Yukon LX with black rims, was found on March 26 with Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, inside the vehicle. Authorities found the bodies of three children Markis Hart, 19; Jeremiah Hart, 14; Abigail Hart, 14 at the scene. Devonte Hart, 15, Hannah Hart, 16, and Sierra Hart, 12, are still missing. Mendocino County Sheriff Lt. Shannon Barney said rescuers will be searching the water near the crash site Wednesday morning for the three children, who were presumed to be in the vehicle at the time of the crash, Oregon Live reported. On Tuesday, Alexandra Argyropoulos, a former friend of the family, told The Associated Press she alerted Oregon welfare officials about Jennifer and Sarah Hart because she felt they were withholding meals from their six adopted children. Argyropoulos said she \"witnessed in 2013 what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment\" toward the children by the couple, who were living in West Linn at the time. \"My heart is completely broken. The current system failed to protect these children from their abusers,\" Argyropoulos said. Argyropoulos said she was told the children had been interviewed but there was nothing more the Oregon Department of Human Services could do because there was not enough evidence to make a case. CALIFORNIA CLIFF PLUNGE INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON UNACCOUNTED-FOR HART TRIBE CHILDREN A similar instance also prompted neighbors Bruce and Dana DeKalb to alert Child Protective Services three days before the family was found dead. They feared Devonte who gained nationwide fame after a photo of him at a 2014 Portland, Ore., rally holding a \"Free Hugs\" sign went viral was going hungry because he would been coming over to their house too often in the past week asking for food. Authorities attempted to reach the family three times and made their third attempt the day after their SUV was found. Investigators believe the deadly crash may have not been an accident as originally thought after evidence suggested the driver, Jennifer Hart, accelerated off the side of the road. Court documents stated the speedometer of the SUV was pinned at 90 mph, though authorities warned the device could have been altered at impact. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "A timeline of the final days of the Washington family killed in an apparently intentional car crash in California is coming together. Jennifer Hart, 38, was caught on surveillance footage at a Safeway store in Fort Bragg, Calif., around 8am on March 25, the day before the family's SUV plunged off a cliff about 15 miles north of the area, Fox News reports. The bodies of Jennifer Hart who was driving the SUV as well as her wife, Sarah, and three of their six adopted children have since been found; authorities are still searching for the couple's three other children. Jennifer Hart was purchasing bananas and other groceries during the Safeway trip; it is not clear where the rest of the family was, NBC News reports. The children ranged in age from 12 to 19; their parents were under investigation for alleged abuse or neglect at the time of the crash. Investigators have also been interviewing neighbors, searching the family's Washington home, and looking into cellphone pings. So far, they know the family was south of Portland by 8:15am March 24, and then drove south along the coast until, by 8pm, they were in the Fort Bragg area. They were there a little more than 24 hours, then headed north up the coast. Their GMC Yukon went off the cliff, falling 70 feet to an embankment below, on March 26; a passerby reported it to police around 3:30pm. Authorities say it appeared to have accelerated over the edge and that no skid marks were found near where it went over. \"As of this date it is still unclear if the missing children were inside the vehicle during the incident,\" the CHP said in a news release, but the missing children are tentatively presumed dead.

    "document": "NEW YORK CBSNewYork Investigators say the bomb that went off in Chelsea contained residue of an explosive compound that is easy to find. CBS2's Alice Gainer reported Tannerite, which is the brand name, is unregulated and that anyone can buy it. The compound is sold as a mix of two chemicals and it creates high explosives when combined. An instructional video on Tannerite Sports' website explains how the exploding target works. \"Pour the contents of the catalyst packet into the mixing container,\" the instructor said in the video. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives defines binary explosives as pre-packaged products consisting of two separate components typically an oxidizer like ammonium nitrate and a fuel like aluminum or another metal. The ATF does not regulate the compound because separately, the chemicals do not meet the definition of explosive. In response to the Chelsea explosion, Tannerite Sports said it is working to determine if their product was definitely used in Saturday's explosion. \"As far as our knowledge and independent testing results show, our product can only be set off by a successful high-power rifle shot directly to the target; and in addition that once done it vaporizes as it is an endothermic product,\" the company said in a statement. Manny Gomez, a former FBI agent and security expert, said the company is being on the \"defensive.\" \"They are being defensive. The bottom line is not if that was used, the bottom line is that product, as well as other products, are easily accessible and could detonate a pressure cooker,\" Gomez explained. He continued, \"Just like you set off a round in a rifle simply by pushing a little snap, every round has its own little detonator, it is a similar thing with a pressure cooker. The only thing is that they used old-fashioned flip phones as a method of detonation.\" Gomez compared the product to gasoline put in cars, noting people use it responsibly, but if used inappropriately, that could light a building up. \"It is just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" Gomez said. Though they do not regulate it, ATF has put out advisories about binary explosives before. They ask people to report any unusual activity with these materials. For example, if someone is attempting to buy a large quantity while knowing very little about the product. The suspect in the bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, will be charged with five counts of attempted murder. <doc_sep> The bomb that exploded Saturday in New York City used an explosive called Tannerite, according to news reports. Until now, Tannerite has mostly been known to target shooters. Now it is being implicated in a terrorist attack. Here are answers to some questions about an explosive you might not have heard of and its role in this unfolding story. What is Tannerite? Tannerite is the brand name of a binary explosive often used as a rifle target. Binary explosives are two-part mixtures of components that are not explosive on their own. The original patent for Tannerite describes a mixture of ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate and powdered aluminum and a few minor ingredients. Steve Yerger, an investigator for the company, says the current proprietary formulation uses just the ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum. Generic mixtures of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum, sometimes called ammonal, are sometimes also called Tannerite, like calling all facial tissues Kleenexes. Why are people using this stuff? Tannerite is popular for target practice because it produces a loud bang and a puff of smoke when hit with a fast-moving bullet. That makes it more obvious-and more exciting-when you hit the target than, say, shooting a piece of paper. The reason they use Tannerite specifically is because it is easy to get and relatively safe. Because the two components are not themselves explosive, the Federal government does not regulate Tannerite like it does black powder or TNT. You can buy it online or in stores, and the individual components are available on their own. Okay. Is it dangerous? It can be. Although Tannerite was designed to produce a relatively small explosion for safety, people have been seriously hurt and even killed using it. In most cases that happened when it was detonated inside a container, which fragmented and sent shrapnel flying at the victims. Binary explosives do have an inherent degree of safety, in that they are not explosive until the two parts are mixed. And how does it work? A chemical explosive has two fundamental components: a fuel and an oxidizer. The fuel releases energy when it reacts. The oxidizer provides the oxygen atoms the fuel needs in order to react. In your fireplace, wood is the fuel and the air around us is the oxidizer. In the patented recipe for Tannerite, the fuel is aluminum powder with some titanium. The oxidizer is a mixture of ammonium nitrate and ammonium perchlorate, the key part being the \"ate\" on the ends of those words. That means they contain oxygen, in this case bound to nitrogen and chlorine atoms respectively. Ammonal, the generic version is usually just the aluminum powder and ammonium nitrate. When mixed together, the components need a certain amount of energy to set off the explosive reaction. In the case of Tannerite, that comes from the kinetic energy of a fast-moving bullet. Oxygen atoms leave nitrate and perchlorate and bind to aluminum atoms to form aluminum oxide. That is the stuff that gives untreated aluminum its rough, ashy look. Like all explosive reactions, it works because the products are more stable than the starting components. Going from less stable compounds to more stable compounds releases energy in the form of heat and light. In the case of Tannerite or ammonal, the reaction also produces a gas, whose expansion in a sealed container adds to the explosive power of a bomb. Ammonium nitrate sounds kind of familiar. Where have I heard that name before? Ammonium nitrate had figured in high-profile explosions before. It was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and was the because of an accidental explosion in 2013 in West, Texas that killed 15 people. Explosives use nitrogen-containing compounds like ammonium nitrate because they produce nitrogen gas. TNT, trinitrotoluene, is a famous example. Nitrogen gas, which makes up almost 80 of our atmosphere, is two nitrogen atoms joined by a triple bond. That triple bond is incredibly strong, meaning it takes a huge amount of energy to break. Conversely, the bond releases a huge amount of energy when it forms. In Tannerite or TNT, the formation of nitrogen gas is one source of their explosive energy. So Tannerite was the explosive in the New York City bombs? Maybe. First, to be clear, the name Tannerite is appearing in news stories attributed to unnamed law enforcement sources. Tannerite residue was reportedly found on the two bombs discovered in New York over the weekend. Other bombs linked to the suspect, Ahmad Rahami, who is now in custody, may have used different explosives. These reports may be wrong in part or whole. The company that makes Tannerite is skeptical. Steve Yerger, the company investigator, says he has not been able to confirm with the FBI or other law enforcement agencies that Tannerite was in fact found in the New York bombs. What is more, he says he does not know how it could have been used. In the company's tests, says Yerger, Tannerite can only be detonated by the impact of a high-velocity bullet. A burning fuse, an electrical current, a hammer blow; none of those will work, according to him. There have been no reports that a gunshot was used to trigger the bomb that exploded in New York on Saturday. What Yerger says is entirely plausible. He has not shared the results of the tests he is talking about, but explosives can be and are made so that they only explode in certain ways. \"That is in keeping with a lot of explosive materials,\" says Dave Welch, a senior explosives expert at Ramora UK, which does bomb disposal. Welch could not confirm Yerger's assertions about Tannerite specifically. There are other ways to detonate an aluminum oxide and ammonium nitrate bomb though. The bombs in this test of ammonal done by scientists at the Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs were set off with standard detonators and boosters used to produce a shock with enough energy to explode the mixture. We will need more information from law enforcement agencies before we know what happened in Chelsea. Correction: This post has been updated with information from the Tannerite company about the product's formula. <doc_sep> Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE A visual timeline of the bombing attacks and attempted bombing attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend of Sept. 17th and 18th. USA TODAY NEW YORK, NY SEPTEMBER 18: FBI agents review the crime scene of remnants of bomb debris on 23rd St. in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on September 18, 2016 in New York City. An explosion that injured 29 people that went off in a construction dumpster is being labeled an \"intentional act\". A second device, a pressure cooker, was found four blocks away that an early investigation found was likely also a bomb. Photo by Stephanie Keith Getty Images Photo: Stephanie Keith, Getty Images The bomb that exploded in Manhattan on Saturday contained residue of Tannerite, a legal product used primarily for target practice. Tannerite explodes when struck by a bullet from a high-powered rifle so ranges put it on targets as a way to prove a target has been struck. The brand-name product is defined as a \"binary explosive\" by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firerams and Exposives ATF This means it is sold in two inert pieces, said Jimmie Oxley, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island. It is not an explosive until the two parts are mixed, Oxley said. Even when two separate parts ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder are mixed, the compound will not explode until it is hit by the bullet, she said. Tannerite cannot be set off by a smoldering fuse, an electronic fuse, an electrical current, an open flame, impact with a hammer or even a low-velocity handgun, according to Steve Yerger, a corporate investigator for Tannerite. It is a very stable product, he said. A federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation confirmed that investigators found Tannerite residue the bomb that exploded in Chelsea, injuring 29 people on Saturday night. Tannarite makes it easy for shooters at a range to easily determine whether their shot hit its intended target, Yerger said. Tannerite is sold in many sporting goods stores. It is also available on the Tannerite website. \"We feel horrible that Tannerite has been associated with the bombing,\" Yerger said, On its Facebook page Monday afternoon, the company said that it was aware of the bombing in New York and the explosive devices found in New Jersey. \"The entire staff of Tannerite stands together in the abhorrence and unintended use of all products that are misused for violence and hate,\" the Facebook post said. The ATF does not regulate the sale and distribution of the two chemicals used in Tannerite and similar products, even when sold together in binary \"kits,\" the ATF said.

Though federal regulations are lacking, one state is attempting to regulate the sale of Tannerite: After a failed attempt last year, Indiana state senator Jim Merritt will again introduce a bill in January 2017 that would prohibit the sale of Tannerite to customers younger than 18 and also require retailers to place the products behind the counter or in a locked display case. Though Merritt said he is all for target practice, this is a \"common-sense approach,\" he said, noting several instances of Indiana residents hurt by flying shrapnel in Tannerite-related explosions.

    "document": "A protester wearing a jacket with \"No THAAD\" letters, participates during a rally to oppose the plan to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, in front of the Defense Ministry. Associated Press SEOUL, South Korea AP YOU.S. missile launchers and other equipment needed to set up a controversial missile defense system have arrived in South Korea, the YOU.S. and South Korean militaries said Tuesday, a day after North Korea test-launched four ballistic missiles into the ocean near Japan. The plans to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, within this year have angered not only North Korea, but also China and Russia, which see the system's powerful radars as a security threat. China responded quickly, saying it will take \"necessary measures\" to protect itself and warning that the YOU.S. and South Korea should be prepared to bear the consequences. Washington and Seoul say the system is defensive and not meant to be a threat to Beijing or Moscow. The YOU.S. military said in a statement that THAAD can intercept and destroy short and medium range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights. \"Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday's launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea,\" Adm. Harry Harris, head of the YOU.S. Pacific Command, said in the statement. Some South Korean liberal presidential candidates have said that the security benefits of having THAAD would be curtailed by worsened relations with neighbors China and Russia. \"China firmly opposes the deployment of THAAD,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing Tuesday. \"We will definitely be taking necessary measures to safeguard our own security interest. All consequences entailed from that will be borne by the YOU.S. and South Korea We once again strongly urge the relevant sides to stop the process of deployment and refrain from going further down that wrong path.\" China's condemnation of South Korea's plans to deploy THAAD has triggered protests against a South Korean retail giant, Lotte, which agreed to provide one of its golf courses in southern South Korea as the site of THAAD. The South Korean government also raised concerns about a reported ban on Chinese tour groups visiting the country. On Tuesday, China's Global Times, an outspoken nationalist tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's flagship People's Daily, criticized North Korea over the missiles. \"By firing four missiles at once this time, the military confrontation between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington escalates a notch,\" the paper said. \"Noticeably, the Chinese public is angry that Pyongyang's nuclear program has provided an excuse for Seoul to deploy THAAD.\" An official from South Korea's Defense Ministry, who did not want to be named, citing office rules, said that the equipment that arrived in South Korea included launchers, but did not confirm how many. While South Korea's media speculate that the THAAD deployment could be completed by as early as April, the ministry official could not confirm those reports. The official said that the plan was to have the system operational as soon as possible. On Monday, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles in an apparent protest against ongoing YOU.S.-South Korean military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. The missiles flew about 1,000 kilometers 620 miles on average, three of them landing in waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone, according to South Korean and Japanese officials. The North's state media on Tuesday said leader Kim Jong Un supervised a ballistic rocket launching drill, a likely reference to the four launches reported by Seoul and Tokyo. Involved in the drills were artillery units tasked with striking \"YOU.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Japan,\" according to the Korean Central News Agency. There was pride and defiance among the elite citizens who live in North Korea's showcase capital, Pyongyang. \"If the YOU.S. imperialists and their South Korean puppets shoot even just one spark into our sovereign territory, we will completely destroy those aggressors, without any mercy, with our invincible Hwasong artillery, which are loaded with nuclear warheads,\" Sim Chol Su, echoing the propaganda often found in state media, told The Associated Press. North Korea uses \"Hwasong\" to describe a broad range of its ballistic missiles, including Scuds and the mid-range missiles that are referred to as Rodong and Musudan by outside analysts. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the missiles fired by the North were believed to be \"improved versions\" of Scud missiles. South Korean experts say North Korea's extended-range Scuds and mid-range Rodong missiles are capable of hitting Japan, including YOU.S. military bases in Okinawa. Kim \"ordered the KPA Korean People's Army Strategic Force to keep highly alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime,\" a KCNA dispatch said. _ Associated Press writers Chris Bodeen and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report. <doc_sep> Image copyright Reuters Image caption The defence system will take out any missiles considered a threat to South Korea The US says it has begun deploying the first parts of a controversial missile defence system in South Korea. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system Thaad is designed to protect against threats from North Korea. The move to begin installing the system comes a day after the North launched four ballistic missiles, breaking international sanctions. But the US-South Korean arrangement has angered many on the Korean peninsula and around the region, including China. South Korean media said operations to install a Thaad battery had begun on Monday, with some parts flown from the US to an air base near Seoul. A statement from the US military confirmed that the \"first elements\" of the system had been sent to South Korea. South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, said the system could be operational \"as early as April\". Chinese foreign spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that China opposed the deployment and would \"resolutely take necessary measures to defend our own security interests\". What is the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System Thaad Shoots down short and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight Uses hit-to-kill technology where kinetic energy destroys the incoming warhead Has a range of 200km and can reach an altitude of 150km US has previously deployed it in Guam and Hawaii as a measure against potential attacks from North Korea What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have? 1. The enemy launches a missile 2. The Thaad radar system detects the launch, which is relayed to command and control 3. Thaad command and control instructs the launch of an interceptor missile 4. The interceptor missile is fired at the enemy projectile 5. The enemy projectile is destroyed in the terminal phase of flight The launcher trucks can hold up to eight interceptor missiles. But the deployment is controversial? There is domestic opposition many South Koreans believe the defence system will itself become a target, endangering people who live around the military sites. Opponents have staged multiple demonstrations. Internationally, both China and Russia have raised concerns, saying the system could affect the regional security balance. Last year, China's foreign minister said the system went \"far beyond\" the defence needs of the Korean peninsula. Russia's envoy to Seoul has called it a \"direct threat\" to national security. So why is China worried? By Jonathan Marcus, BBC News defence correspondent The Thaad system is well-suited to defend South Korean targets against relatively limited range North Korean missiles. But it has no ability to intercept Chinese inter-continental ballistic missiles that target the US. Why then is China so annoyed? What concerns Beijing is the system's powerful X-band radars that can \"reach\" far into Chinese territory. The Chinese military worries that these could be used to spot Chinese missile launches and feed the data to cue up other US defensive systems, eg interceptor missiles based in the US, potentially affecting China's deterrent capability. But the US already has powerful radars based in Japan and a Thaad system in Guam. It is not easy to quantify the additional benefit that Thaad radars in South Korea would give the Pentagon. But they will certainly give the South Koreans an important and expanded new layer of defence against missile attack. What happened in the latest missile launch? North Korea threatened last week to fire missiles in response to the start of the Foal Eagle US-South Korean military exercises. The annual drills infuriate the North, which sees them as preparation for an invasion from the South. Then early on Monday, it fired four missiles from the Tongchang-ri region, near the border with China. Three of the projectiles flew some 1,000km 620 miles and fell into Japan's exclusive economic zone EEZ The exact type of missile is not yet clear but South Korean officials said they appeared to be an upgraded version of a Scud missile. What was the international reaction? The US and Japanese leaders held phone discussions after the missile launch and the United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday in an emergency meeting requested by the US and Japan to discuss the incident. Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US South Pacific Command, said the launch confirmed \"the prudence\" of the decision to deploy Thaad. But the deployment will likely worsen tensions between Seoul and Beijing. In recent days South Korea has accused China of economic retaliation linked to Thaad in areas, including tourism and air travel. There has also been an outpouring of anger by Chinese consumers against the South Korean retailer Lotte, which allowed Thaad to be installed on one of its sites. Several of Lotte's stores in China have been closed down suddenly. Beijing rejects claims of economic retaliation. Is China retaliating against Lotte missile deal?",

Nash, and his wife, Alicia Nash, died last month in a crash on the New Jersey Turnpike after returning from Norway to receive the top mathematics award.

In light of his passing, Princeton has digitized his academic file and released it to the public; you can see the full PDF here. Probably the best document it contains is a recommendation letter by Richard Duffin, Nash's undergraduate advisor at the Carnegie Institute of Technology now Carnegie Mellon to Solomon Lefschetz, a math professor at Princeton, where Nash was applying to grad school: The letter was successful. Nash went on to get his PhD at Princeton. His dissertation, \"Non-cooperative games,\" introduced a concept that would become known as the \"Nash equilibrium,\" a crucial concept in game theory. Khan Academy explains the idea, and how it relates to the famous prisoner's dilemma game, here: Nash's dissertation has been cited about 7,189 times, according to Google Scholar, though that excludes many uses of the term \"Nash equilibrium\" that do not cite the actual paper. \"If Nash got a dollar for every time someone wrote or said 'Nash equilibrium,'\" Princeton economist Avinash Dixit once wrote, \"he would be a rich man.\" Nash submitted his thesis in May 1950, when he was 21 years old. It was a mere 27 pages long, which includes an acknowledgements section and a very short bibliography. The entire dissertation cites only two sources: game theory's founders John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, and John Nash.",

VPC Rachel Lehnardt, 35, of Evans, Ga., was charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in connection with a recent party at her home near Augusta. Photo: Columbia County Sheriff's Office A 35-year-old Georgia mother has lost custody of her five children after being arrested for allegedly hosting a party for her teenage daughter and partaking of booze, pot, sex, a hot tub and naked Twister. Rachel Lehnardt was charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for the party at her home in Evans, an Augusta suburb. She was arrested Monday after her new Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor alerted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office on Saturday following a meeting with Lehnardt, according to the investigation report. The sponsor said Lehnardt, who is divorcing her husband, an Iraq war veteran, told her she had lost custody of the children ages 4, 6, 8, 10 and 16 at an emergency hearing April 6 after he learned about the recent party. The sheriff's report did not indicate when it occurred. The children were with their father one night when the 16-year-old daughter texted her mother to ask if she and some friends could come over \"to party,\" according to the sponsor's account. \"Come on, let us party,\" Lehnardt replied. The teens drank alcohol and smoked marijuana, Lehnardt said she joined them playing naked Twister, her sponsor told investigators. She then had sex in the bathroom with an 18-year-old boy, the report said. The sponsor said Lenhardt later recounted waking up at 3:30 a.m. to discover her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend having sex with her. He is not facing charges because \"there is no evidence of rape\" because Lehnardt \"refuses to discuss the case,\" Capt. Steve Morris told the New York Daily News. Lehnardt, who works in an Augusta bridal shop, had been attending a sexual-addiction workshop at her local Mormon church, the sponsor added. She was released after posting a 3,200 bond.

The crazy night began after Rachel Lehnardt's 16-year-old daughter texted her asking if she could bring friends over \"to party,\" according to a Columbia County Sheriff's Office report. \"Come on, let us party,\" the 35-year-old mother of five replied. Lehnardt provided weed and alcohol to the partying teens at her Evans home before joining them in a game of naked Twister, the sponsor told authorities. The former Mormon Sunday school teacher found an 18-year-old to have a private game with and the two snuck off to a bathroom to have sex, according to the sheriff's report. The bridal shop employee was still \"horny,\" so she brought her sex toys into the living room and used them in front of the group, according to the police report. \"The party continued\" in Lehnardt's hot tub before Lenhardt passed out in her bed, the report said. She woke up around 3:30 a.m. to find her daughter's well-endowed 16-year-old boyfriend having sex with her, the sponsor said. \"Her daughter 'felt guilty' because the 16-year-old was 10-inches long and huge, and if she had been able to take it he would not have needed to rape her mother,\" the sponsor said. The boy is not facing a rape charge because \"there is no evidence of rape,\" since Lehnardt \"refuses to discuss the case,\" Captain Steve Morris told the Daily News. A source close to Lehnardt said the alleged rape made her realize that her drinking, which she started doing when she separated from her husband in November, was a problem. Most attractive mug shots The raucous party also forced Lehnardt to lose custody of her children, ages 4, 6, 8, 10 and 16, on April 6, the sponsor said. Growing up in the Mormon Church, Lehnardt never touched a drop of alcohol before her husband of 15 years came back from a deployment to Iraq with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and anger issues in 2010, the source said. \"People who have never drunk a day in their life tend not to know how to handle their alcohol,\" the source said. The party made Lehnardt decide to go sober, and four days later, she met with a woman in Alcoholics Anonymous who she knew from her Mormon church. She spilled the salacious details and reportedly admitted to showing photos of her having sex with her boyfriend to her 16-year-old daughter. The sponsor, who \"struggled\" to look like she was not judging Lehnardt during the tale, reported the rager to police Friday. Lehnardt was arrested on two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was released on 3,200 bond, Morris said. \"Just when you think you have seen everything or heard everything, we find that we have not,\" Morris said. Her attorney, Shawn P. Hammond, told the Daily News that some of the accusations \"were exaggerated.\" \"It is a difficult situation for the entire family,\" Hammond said. \"This mom is attempting to accept responsibility for her conduct and will do everything in her power to make amends to the public and her children and will never allow this conduct to be repeated.\" Lehnardt plans to attend counseling and will continue to attend AA meetings, he said.

Rachel Lenhardt, 35, was charged Monday with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly providing marijuana and alcohol to minors at her home on Whitney Pass in Evans. The sponsor told investigators that she was recently asked to help Lenhardt, so she asked her over for coffee on April 10 to talk about Lenhardt's plans for sobriety and such. Lenhardt informed her she was four days sober since April 6 when she lost custody of her five children ages 4, 6, 8, 10 and 16. Lenhardt told her that an emergency hearing was conducted this month when her kids were taken away from her due to an incident that occurred at her house.

The group and Lenhardt then got in her hot tub naked where the party continued. Lenhardt said she was asleep in her bed and woke up around 3:30 a.m. when she felt someone having sex with her. She thought it was the 18-year-old but realized it was her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend. The daughter later told her mother that she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was too large for her and he needed to have sex instead with the mother. Lenhardt also told her sponsor that she had shown her daughter pornographic photos, including photos of her and her current boyfriend having sex. The sponsor told investigators that Lenhardt has opened up about being a sexual deviant and porn addict. Sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said this week's arrest of Lenhardt is based partially on the account given to them by the AA sponsor. He said no sexual crime charges were being filed because 16 is the legal age of consent.",

The Douglas and Maria DeVos Foundation, financially supported by Amway president Doug DeVos, donated 500,000 to the National Organization for Marriage NOM an anti-gay marriage group that was one of the leading advocates against same-sex marriage initiatives in eight states. Because of that 2009 donation, gay rights activist are calling for a boycott of Ada, Mich.-based Amway, a health and beauty products company, and its affiliates including the Orlando Magic basketball team, which DeVos' father and Amway co-founder Richard DeVos owns. \"NOM constantly defends anti-LGBT companies like its ally Chick-fil-A and its owner for hateful and bigoted comments and actions,\" gay rights activist and long-shot presidential candidate Fred Karger wrote in a statement announcing the boycott Friday. Karger, the president of the LGBT advocacy group Rights Equal Rights, said the goal of groups like the National Organization for Marriage \"appears to be harming Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender LGBT Americans.\" But Amway said the donation stemmed from DeVos' personal beliefs and the \"Amway opportunity is open to everyone.\" \"As private citizens, the DeVos family supports causes and organizations that advocate for policies aligned to their personal beliefs,\" Amway said in a statement.

Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy ignited a controversy in a radio interview last week when he publicly denounced gay marriage. \"I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'\" Cathy said. \"I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about.\" The restaurant has long-espoused Christian values, even going so far as to remain closed on Sundays. In response to the company's stance even before Cathy's comments, online cooking guru Hilah Johnson launched a \"Chick-fil-Gay\" sandwich recipe on her blog and YouTube \"HilahCooking\" channel. Johnson referred to the recipe as a way to get the taste of a Chick-fil-A sandwich with \"less sugar, less salt, and less funding for anti-human-equality organizations.\" In a statement made after the CEO's remarks, Chick-fil-A reaffirmed its foundation on \"biblically-based principles,\" but also said that \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect, regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\" Company officials said they plan to \"leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena\" in the future. Google During the first week of July, Google announced a new \"Legalize Love\" campaign to help promote safer working environments for gays and lesbians around the world. While originally understood by many as a campaign to support the legalization of gay marriage, Google has since clarified the goals of the project, saying that it is intended to create safer conditions for gays and lesbians \"in countries with anti-gay laws on the books.\" Google leadership has long been pro-gay rights, and outspokenly so; its CEO, Sergey Brin, spoke out against California's Proposition 8 in 2008. Google began compensating employees in 2010 with same-sex partners to help cover taxes on domestic partner health benefits. facebook.com oreo Kraft Foods The packaged foods giant posted this photo of a rainbow Oreo on its Facebook page in June in support of gay-pride month. An outpouring of responses quickly flooded the company's page, and consumers' posts ranged from the supportive to the damning. \"Disgusted with oreos,\" one commenter wrote. \"Being gay is an abmonitation sic in God's eyes i will not be buying them anymore.\" Kraft did not actually sell the rainbow-stuffed Oreo, and said the digitally altered image was created simply for online posting as part of the company's support for gay pride month. Nonetheless, some consumers said they would boycott the company a statement that led supporters of gay marriage to strike back, listing the myriad of foods everything from Capri Sun juice to Velveeta to Triscuits that boycotters of the food giant would have to swear off in order to make good on that claim. Courtesy Ben Jerrys Ben Jerry's Ben Jerry's has been publicly supportive of gay marriage since 2009, when it renamed its \"Chubby Hubby\" flavor to \"Hubby Hubby\" to celebrate the passage of Vermont legislature allowing gay marriage. More recently, the Vermont ice cream merchant renamed its apple pie ice cream \"Apple-y Ever After\" as part of a push to legalize gay marriage in the United Kingdom. Ben Jerry's encourages customers to get involved in advocacy efforts on its website and through Facebook apps. General Mills Minneapolis-based General Mills recently stepped straight into a contentious battle surrounding an amendment to the Minnesota constitution that would ban gay marriage. General Mills, which is headquartered in Minnesota, announced in June that it was against the amendment. While the firm had long been considered an ally of the gay and lesbian community, its public announcement was unexpected. Protestors and supporters came out of the woodwork after General Mills made its position clear. Protestors gathered outside the company's headquarters soon after the announcement, but the firm stayed cordial, offering the activists coffee, water and even cookies the last of which the protestors turned down",

Following the uproar over Chick-fil-A and same-sex marriage, gay rights advocates are pushing for a boycott of cleaning and beauty products company Amway and its affiliates, which include the Orlando Magic basketball team. The boycott call is in response to a 500,000 donation to battle gay marriage made by a foundation funded by Amway president Doug DeVos.

    "document": "LONDON Reuters Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain's exit from the European Union. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS Britain's March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. \"It is a terrible result for the prime minister,\" Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. \"The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.\" But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her \"comfortably\". ENDANGERING BREXIT? May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal struck after two years of negotiations that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. Brexit is Britain's most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the YOU.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. The outcome will shape Britain's 2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain's 2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. Sterling jumped as high as 1.2672 GBP D3 as the result came in but then fell to 1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected. <doc_sep> Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. She is understood to have promised not to call a \"snap general election\" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority. But, she added: \"I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election.\" Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said \"she was very clear that she will not be taking the general election in 2022\". But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a \"half-hearted\" reception from MPs. She had said it was not her \"intention\" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a \"politician's word\". Marcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May \"did not really have anything new to say\" about Brexit. She vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen. And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs not just Conservative ones when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. \"Whatever happens tonight I do not think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue.\" Minister Margot James said she was \"proud\" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper. Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker lonelier and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. The parliamentary sums do not change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, will not give their backing. Read Laura's blog Can she survive the confidence vote? Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was \"the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29\", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would \"flush out the extremists\" in his party whose Brexit agenda was \"not in the interests of the British people\". So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive. If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year. If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. If Mrs May won but not overwhelmingly she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand.

In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: \"A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic. \"Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest.\" She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to \"deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead\". The Conservatives had to build a \"country that works for everyone\" and deliver \"the Brexit people voted for\". \"I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job.\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"I stand ready to finish the job\" Theresa May Will there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote? Not immediately. She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party, a process that could take up to six weeks. If there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members. As leader of the largest party in the Commons, the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister, without a general election. It is Wednesday, so. Prime Minister's Questions Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn criticises Theresa May at PMQs Mrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit or hold another EU referendum at a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The time for dithering and delay is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. \"There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before Parliament and let us have the vote.\" Mrs May said the vote will take place, and as Labour MPs shouted \"when?\" at her she said: \"We have had a meaningful vote, we had it in in the referendum in 2016.\" The PM added: \"And if he wants a meaningful date I will give him one; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union.\" Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest \"unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible\", prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches. But the SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down, saying her government was \"an embarrassment\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'The inconstant gardener' May's PMQs swipe at Labour Who is trying to oust Mrs May? Image copyright PA Image caption Jacob Rees-Mogg: In the national interest, she must go The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month. But her decision to cancel Tuesday's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt. There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go out of 317 Conservative MPs to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: \"Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it. \"Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.\" And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would \"get a kicking\" in the vote and that their \"pompous gesturing\" will be exposed. Why are they trying to get rid of her? They do not like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. Anger has focused on the so-called \"backstop\" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be \"temporary\" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated. Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses? Image copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers. Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. What does it mean for Brexit? Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to \"adopt relevant conclusions\". European Council President Donald Tusk has said the \"seriousness\" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. Mrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated. <doc_sep> 19:29 What about the 'meaningful vote'? The result clearly highlights May's essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can \"bin the backstop\". However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement which contains the Northern Irish backstop is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all. So the Brexit fundamentals at Westminster remain, for now, unchanged. <doc_sep> Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement in Downing Street, London, confirming there will be a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, Wednesday December 12, 2018. The. Associated Press LONDON AP The Latest on political turmoil in Britain all times local 5:35 p.m. Prime Minister Theresa May is speaking to dozens of Conservative lawmakers, less than half an hour before a no-confidence vote among them that will decide her fate. May was greeted by table banging as she entered a room in the House of Commons to address backbenchers. That is a customary sign of approval, but May faces a tough crowd that includes rivals such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis. Both are among critics of May's Brexit deal with the European Union. Tory Brexiteers are hoping to topple May in Wednesday evening's vote. She is making a last-minute appeal, saying ditching her now would plunge the country into even more uncertainty. One lawmaker who attended, James Cleverly, said May \"made it very clear that there is a job of work to be done on Brexit and this is a delay and a distraction.\" _ 4:25 p.m. British bookmakers William Hill say they have suspended betting on the question of whether Prime Minister Theresa May will win a confidence vote by her party. William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams says that the odds favored May from the beginning of the day, and did nothing but improve as Wednesday night's vote neared. Before betting was suspended, people putting money on a May win had to wager 10 pounds to win one pound. Adams says the firm suspended betting because \"we are 100 percent certain she is going to win.\" _ 4 p.m. Some Londoners are reacting with sympathy at the news that Prime Minister Theresa May faces a confidence vote that may remove her from power. Abby Handbridge, a trader at Chapel Market in north London, said Wednesday that the spectacle was \"embarrassing\" for Britain in the eyes of the world. \"I feel really sorry for Theresa May,\" she said. \"She is being battered by everybody and Boris Johnson has just come out with a haircut and weight loss so we know what he is looking for.\" Another trader, 61-year-old David White, compared May's Conservative Party challengers to \"rats deserting a sinking ship.\" \"I do not think it should have come to this,\" he said of the formal challenge to May. Support was hardly unanimous, though, with some traders saying May is power hungry. Lawmakers casting their votes of confidence in a secret ballot later Wednesday. _ 1:45 p.m. Germany's Cabinet has approved legislation to protect British residents' rights in the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit and to make the country a more attractive location for banks seeking to relocate. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said ministers have approved a bill safeguarding the German health insurance, unemployment insurance and pension status of British citizens living in Germany and German citizens living in Britain at the time of Brexit. The future status of those citizens affected by the Brexit process remains especially uncertain following the news earlier that Prime Minister Theresa May will face a no-confidence vote later from lawmakers in her own party. A withdrawal agreement ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in March has yet to be voted on by the British Parliament. Another German bill foresees loosening the requirement for banks to justify why they are ending a contract with a highly paid employee deemed to be a \"bearer of risk,\" such as heads of department or high-volume traders. Germany has much more restrictive rules on dismissing workers than Britain, which is seen as a disincentive for Britain-based banks to shift operations to Frankfurt. _ 12:25 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is underlining the European Union's insistence on sticking to the Brexit agreement as it stands, but stressing that she remains committed to an orderly British withdrawal. Merkel, who met Tuesday with British Prime Minister Theresa May, noted that \"things are in flux\" in London. She said that \"we do not have any intention of changing the withdrawal agreement\" but otherwise did not go into detail. Merkel said that Germany remains committed to securing an orderly British withdrawal, and said that \"we do not have much time, but we still have time.\" _ 10:55 a.m. Business figures have expressed alarm about the political uncertainty in the YOU.K. ahead of a Conservative Party confidence vote on Prime Minister Theresa May later. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said politicians should understand the impact of their \"high stakes gambles\" with Britain's economy. \"At one of the most pivotal moments for the YOU.K. economy in decades, it is unacceptable that Westminster politicians have chosen to focus on themselves, rather than on the needs of the country,\" he said after the Conservative Party said there would a vote on May's leadership. He said there was \"utter dismay\" among businesses about the vote on Wednesday evening. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the current turmoil is \"weighing heavy\" on entrepreneurs. _ 9 a.m. British Prime Minister Theresa May says a change of national leader would result in Britain's departure from the European Union being delayed or stopped, as she vowed to fight to stay in power. May made the defiant statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday, arguing that stepping aside at a time of crisis would \"put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it.\" The YOU.K. leader is facing a no-confidence vote that will see her removed as party and government leader if she loses. _ 8:50 a.m. YOU.K. leader Theresa May is vowing to fight a no-confidence vote \"with everything I have got,\" appealing to party colleagues to support her leadership. The announcement of the challenge to May's leadership throws Britain's already rocky path out of the European Union, which it is due to leave in March, into further chaos. Many Tory lawmakers have been growing angry with May over her handling of Brexit, and the challenge comes days after she postponed a vote to approve a divorce deal with the EU to avoid all but certain defeat. If she loses Wednesday's vote, May must step down and there will be a contest to choose a new leader. She will remain leader, and prime minister, until the successor is picked. If she wins, she cannot be challenged again for a year. _ 7:55 a.m. A British Conservative Party official says Prime Minister Theresa May will face a no-confidence vote from party lawmakers. Graham Brady says the threshold of 48 letters from lawmakers needed to trigger a leadership vote has been reached. Brady chairs the party committee that oversees leadership contests. Many lawmakers have been growing angry with May over her handling of Brexit. If she loses the vote of party legislators, taking place on Wednesday evening, May must step down.

    "document": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's R exchange with a few hecklers turned into something of a shouting match while he was stumping Thursday in Iowa. Romney faced aggressive inquiries with a liberal bent at the top of the question-and-answer segment of his soapbox speech, which was organized by the The Des Moines Register and broadcast on C-SPAN. ADVERTISEMENT He also waged a defense of low taxes for corporations with a response \"Corporations are people, my friend\" on which Democrats quickly seized. The first two questioners pointedly asked Romney why he would not raise the cap on Social Security taxes, or promise not to cut Medicare benefits. \"If you want to speak, you can speak. But right now, it is my turn,\" Romney said, raising his voice toward the questioners, who bantered back-and-forth with him. But it was his last line in response to a heckler that might stick with Romney the longest. Democrats giddily circulated coverage of the comment; Democratic National Committee DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse emailed reporters an article about the remark with the subject line \"BRUTAL.\" More news from The Hill: Gov.

They create jobs and hire more people.\" For the Romney campaign, the fear about such a remark is that it threatens to underscore perceptions about Romney that he is out of touch. The former Massachusetts governor appeared to have a tin ear earlier this summer when he joked with Florida supporters that he is \"also unemployed.\" The tentative front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination accused the hecklers of wanting to raise taxes. The back-and-forth persisted throughout the Q-and-A period, which took place at the Register's booth at the Iowa State Fair. \"If you do not like my answer, you can go vote for someone else,\" he said. \"If you want someone who will raise taxes, you can vote for Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWebb: President Trump is the elephant in the room Overnight Defense: Trump pulls US out of Iran nuke deal Reaction and fallout Obama calls decision a 'serious mistake' Show of force for CIA pick New questions after briefing on Niger Overnight Finance: Deal on Dodd-Frank rollback Trump pulls US out of Iran nuke deal House votes to repeal auto-loan guidance, setting new precedent MORE.\" This story was posted at 12:02 p.m. and updated at 1:30. <doc_sep> WASHINGTON Speaking to an occasionally rowdy crowd two days before the Ames Straw poll, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made what seems likely to become a much-discussed flub, declaring to a group of Iowans that \"corporations are people.\" Pressed by an attendee at the Iowa State Fair on Thursday as to why he was focusing on entitlement reforms as a means of deficit reduction over asking corporations to share part of the burden, the GOP frontrunner shot back: \"Corporations are people, my friend. of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people. Where do you think it goes? Whose pockets? Whose pockets? People's pockets. Human beings my friend.\" The comment was immediately pounced on by Democrats, who saw it as another example of Romney being uncomfortable on the stump and inartful in his attempts to come off as an everyday pol. \"This is what Mitt Romney is going to run on? Corporations are people? Really?\" said Democratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse. \"There is a great message for people struggling to get by and trying to make ends meet. Do not complain corporations are people too!\" Speaking at the Des Moines Register soapbox, Romney was also interrupted by a heckler who asked if if he supported \"scrapping the Social Security payroll cap so that rich people pay their fair share into the trust fund?\" Romney responded, \"There was a time in this country where we did not celebrate attacking people based on their success. We did not go after people because they were successful. I have watched this president go across the country attacking people, and I. and I am. if you want to speak, you can speak. But right now it is my turn, so let me continue.\" The presidential contender went on to underscore his bottom line. \"If you do not like my answer, you can vote for someone else,\" he said. The situation that unfolded comes ahead of Thursday night's Republican presidential primary debate in the Hawkeye State. It also comes two days before the Ames Straw Poll, a test of conservative strength and table-setter for next year's Iowa caucuses that will take place on Saturday. While Romney will appear on the ballot, he is not actively campaigning to lock up support ahead of the event. \"As you know I participated in a major way in a straw poll four years ago,\" Romney said in addressing his decision to forego the straw poll during an appearance on Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Wednesday night. \"Some of the benefit I already was able to accrue based upon what happened last time around. I want to use my financial resources and my time this time to actually get delegates, not the straw polls they are nice but do not get you delegates I am not going to participate in the straw polls anywhere in the country.\" More video of the heckling, from AP:",

Police used a battering ram to force entry into Salling's residence Tuesday morning. Authorities say when they knocked on the door, announced their presence and called out Salling's name he did not answer. The owner of the home confirmed to authorities the front door is broken.

    "document": "McRAE, Ga. A Georgia couple who vanished after embarking on a road trip to buy a car have been found dead, and both victims were shot in the head, officials say. The two bodies found in the search for the couple were positively identified Tuesday as Elrey \"Bud\" Runion and his wife, June E. Runion, according to a statement posted on Facebook by the Telfair County Sheriff's office. The man who was initially charged with making false statements in the case, Ronnie Adrian \"Jay\" Towns, is now facing charges of murder and armed robbery, according to the statement. Towns was set to be arraigned later Tuesday at the Telfair County Courthouse. Bud Runion posted an ad on the website Craigslist January 19 that he was seeking to buy a 1966 Mustang convertible, and three days later, he and his wife both in their 60s set out for a small farming community in southern Georgia to meet with a potential seller. Then they vanished. Police told CBS Atlanta they believe Towns was the person who answered that ad and said he had a car for sale a car authorities now believe did not exist. They told the station he likely lured the couple for cash. In Telfair County, about a three-hour drive south of the Runions' suburban Atlanta home, days of searching by authorities and volunteers ended Monday with a grim discovery and an arrest. Sheriff Chris Steverson said the couple's SUV had been found in a lake a few miles outside McRae, a tiny city of 5,700 about 80 miles southeast of Macon. Searches discovered two bodies a man and a woman nearby, now identified as the couple. The same day the authorities found bodies, investigators arrested the 28-year-old Towns of McRae on charges of giving false statements to authorities and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception. The sheriff said a cellphone used to make the last known contact with the Runions had been traced to Towns. He said the young man turned himself in Monday accompanied by family members. \"For now, he is the only subject we are seeking,\" Steverson said. The Runions' daughters reported them missing last week after they did not show up to babysit their grandchildren. They told WSB-TV their parents left home with their cellphones and chargers, but no one had heard from them since 3:30 p.m. Thursday. \"If someone has taken them, we have forgiven that person, because God tells us to love and forgive,\" daughter Virginia Owens said before her parents' vehicle was located. <doc_sep> MCRAE-HELENA A Telfair County man was charged with murder Tuesday in the slayings of a Marietta couple last week. Telfair County Magistrate Judge Bryan Selph denied bond for 28-year-old Ronnie \"Jay\" Towns during a hearing late Tuesday afternoon. Afterward, Towns was taken to the Dodge County jail in Eastman. \"I did not do it,\" Towns said softly as deputies led him into the courtroom for his hearing. Towns is charged with killing Bud Runion, 69, and his wife, June, 66, Thursday after he allegedly lured the couple to Telfair County through a response to a Craigslist ad. Bud Runion had been looking to buy a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible, but Towns' answer to the ad was a ruse, authorities said. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said the Runions each were shot in the head with a small-caliber handgun. The bodies were found in the woods near Old Prison Camp Road, not far outside town. The couple's 2003 GMC Envoy was found Monday afternoon in a lake. Towns has been charged with malice murder, armed robbery, making a false statement and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception. Steverson said although Towns had never been arrested previously for a crime in Telfair County, he had been questioned on several occasions during investigations into other theft-related crimes. \"In the past, in the course of previous investigations, his name came up,\" Steverson said. Investigators stopped to question him. But obviously, he does not have any arrest in his record\" before this week. Towns was initially being sought for making a false statement to authorities and an attempt to commit theft by deception. Steverson declined to talk in detail about what led investigators to Towns. Billy McKinnon, owner of McKinnon Inc. Landscape in Helena, said Tuesday that Towns had previously worked for his company, but he was fired several weeks ago for \"a violation of company policies.\" McKinnon declined to comment further. Towns' family reacted with shock and anger at Tuesday's developments. Family members were upset that they found out about Towns' hearing just a few minutes before it happened. They arrived near the conclusion as Selph was ending the hearing. For now, Steverson said, investigators are not looking at charging anyone else. Several of Towns' family said they believe he is not guilty of the charges. \"This is a bunch of crap,\" said Towns' father, also named Ronnie. \"There is something else going on. I do not know if he did it or not. I think someone else is involved. He is a good kid.\" The elder Towns extended his condolences to the Runion family. Gwen Towns, the mother of the accused, said, \"My son did not do this\" as she left the courtroom. Later, while members of the family were talking to Steverson outside his office, she added that \"evidence could have been planted\" in her son's trailer. The family asked Steverson if they could see the evidence, but he told them the case was now with the district attorney's office. Ashley McLaughlin, a public defender from Dublin, said he could not comment on the case. Anne Horton, Jay Towns' aunt, said the news that her nephew had been charged made her ill. \"It floored me,\" she told reporters. \"There is no way, no way! He was always loving, always had a smile on his face. I cannot wrap my brain around this.\" Horton also expressed her sympathy for the victims' family. \"I have so much sorrow for the family, for the Runions,\" she said. \"I hope they get to the bottom of this.\" Earlier, Steverson told national viewers of Fox News that Towns \"comes from a good family.\" The family, he said, is \"well established\" in the small community. \"As you can imagine, the family is as shocked as the rest of the community that he is been named as a suspect in this case,\" Steverson said. The sheriff said the community is a peaceful one despite difficult economic times. According to a 2014 report by the federal government, Telfair County is among the poorest counties in the country, with an average income of 17,536 about 6,000 below the federal poverty line. \"Although we are rural and we do not have the resources that big city police departments do, when we see violent crimes, we pull out all the stops,\" he said. \"We have made progress in this investigation from the beginning.\" Later in the day, Steverson said investigators and prosecutors have a \"mountain of evidence\" to go through in the case.

Towns has been charged with murder and armed robbery. Associated Press A potential seller drew him to a small farming town in southern Georgia where authorities found the couple's SUV on Monday. Nearby, they discovered the body of Runion, 69, and his 66-year-old wife, June, authorities said. Both had been shot in the head. Ronnie Adrian \"Jay\" Towns, 28, of McRae, was accused Tuesday of killing the Runions, a couple from Marietta, Georgia, who were known for their charitable works throughout the South: from storm-damaged Alabama towns and impoverished pockets of West Virginia to housing projects in the Atlanta suburbs. \"He said, 'You cannot take money with you when you are gone,\" said the couple's daughter, Brittany Patterson. \"You might as well spend and enjoy it.\" Years ago, driving through Marietta before Christmas Eve, Runion saw two young girls sorting through a dumpster, his daughter said. He fixed up two bicycles belonging to his own girls and delivered them as gifts. It was the beginning of \"Bud's Bicycles,\" a charity run loosely out of Mount Paran Church of God in Marietta. Runion met his wife, a teacher, at the church in the 1970s. Neighbors said the Runions built a she would in their backyard to house the bikes. Their donations eventually expanded to include food, household and school supplies, coats, blankets even Thanksgiving turkeys. \"Basically, he had a food pantry in the basement of their house,\" Patterson said. Charity came in ways big and small. Patterson remembered as a child going to a doughnut shop with her father on Saturdays. They would often be joined by a man she did not know, and her father would pay the tab. Later in life she realized the man was homeless. While the family was unsure Tuesday morning what transpired in McRae, Patterson had her own assumptions. Her father served in Army's 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, though he never talked to her about the experience in detail. \"He is a survivor and fighter, and I know he would not have gone out without fighting and trying to protect my mother,\" she said. Someone tied flowers to a child's bicycle and left it standing below a flag flying at half-staff in the couple's front yard in Marietta, three hours north of McRae. \"If someone lives their life like this and this happens, it really tests your faith,\" said their neighbor, Tom Murphy. The suspect, Towns, was charged Tuesday with malice murder and armed robbery. A judge denied bond for Towns in his first, brief court appearance. Asked if he understood what he had been charged with, Towns replied: \"I understand.\" His attorney, public defender Ashley McLaughlin, declined to comment afterward. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said robbery appears to be the motive for the couple's killings, but he would not say whether the Runions were carrying cash or disclose other details about the case. On Monday, he said investigators had found no evidence that Towns owned the sort of classic car Runion was seeking. The Runions' slaying shocked residents of McRae, a tiny city about 80 miles southeast of Macon, where a public mural in the downtown square proclaims it is the \"6th Safest City in Georgia.\" Towns grew up on a farm down a long dirt road where his father raised pine trees and grew soybeans, corn and peanuts. Now 28, he had a family of his own a wife and a young daughter in neighboring Wheeler County. Towns supported them by working construction jobs for a local homebuilder, said his uncle, Buddy Towns. \"He is a good kid, and very smart,\" said the uncle, who sometimes hired his nephew to help install carpet and flooring customers had purchased from Buddy Towns' business in McRae. Buddy Towns said it had been six months or so since he needed his nephew's help on a job, but he saw the younger Towns' truck pass his storefront almost daily as he headed to work. He said his nephew remained close to his father, Ronnie Towns Sr., and they often went fishing and hunting together. Towns' family helped persuade him to turn himself in to authorities Monday. Buddy Towns said they were stunned that he would be charged in connection with the Runions' disappearance. \"It just does not make any sense why this would even go down,\" Towns' uncle said. \"It is hard for his parents. They are not understanding.\" The missing couple's friends and family near Atlanta were equally stunned. \"The Bible tells us the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and he saves those who are crushed in spirit,\" said the Rev. Mark Walker, the family's pastor. \"And that is what we are.\" _ Henry reported from Marietta, Georgia.",

    "document": "On June 10, The New York Times inadvertently briefly posted an article on the lives of the women involved in Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal. The article, written by reporter Michael Barbaro, was titled \"For Women in Weiner Scandal, Indignity Lingers.\" It was quickly deleted before being replaced with a production note: \"An article was posted on this page inadvertently, before it was ready for publication,\" read the note left on the story page. \"The story was posted inadvertently before it was ready,\" New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha told BuzzFeed. \"We do not discuss stories in advance of publication.\" But while the story was deleted from the Times website, large portions of it remained cached by Google. By looking at search result listings in a series of more than 100 searches in Google News, it was possible to reconstruct what appears to be the bulk of the article: 1,342 words. The article that emerges is a sympathetic look at several of the women whose names were made public after Weiner accidentally tweeted a lewd picture to a college student. The women, many of whom went public in exchange for cash, and one of whom is a porn star who held a press conference to draw attention to herself, are portrayed as victims of a harsh media environment who have banded together in a shared struggle to reclaim their lives: This is the life of a Weiner Woman: infused with indignity, two years later. Anthony D. Weiner's improbable campaign for mayor of New York is a carefully calibrated wager that voters have made peace with his lewd online behavior, a seemingly victimless cybercrime for which his wife and family have forgiven him. But for the women who were on the other end of Mr. Weiner's sexually explicit conversations, the scandal remains an open sore that has cut short careers, disrupted educations and shattered reputations. In ways big and small, they say, the experience has defined them: once-private details of their lives, as well as their exchanges with Mr. Weiner, are now immortalized on the Internet for all to see and judge. \"I cannot tell you the devastation,\" Lisa Weiss, a blackjack dealer who leaked her emails with Weiner to RadarOnline, is quoted as saying, calling herself \"a little piece of collateral damage from the Weiner situation.\" \"Fans of Mr. Weiner from the start, their feelings about him now are complex and unsettled: Some, like Ms. Weiss, are heartened by his campaign for mayor and rooting for him to win, despite their travails,\" the story says. The porn star Ginger Lee, who capitalized on the situation by staging a press conference with the lawyer Gloria Allred, \"called on Weiner to stay out of the race to spare women like her further anguish,\" the spiked Times story said. \"Every new headline and news story about him reminds reporters and bloggers that we exist, and the cycle starts all over,\" she said through her lawyer. \"There will be a new flare-up of jokes, inaccurate statements, and hurtful remarks.\" Weiss and Traci Nobles, a Georgia fitness instructor, both say in the story that they support his mayoral campaign. \"I think third time is going to be the charm,\" Nobles told the Times. \"A perfect comeback story, ya know?\" Asked about the fallout, Mr. Weiner said in a statement to the Times: \"I am deeply sorry that my behavior caused so much upheaval in the lives of those who were unwittingly involved.\" The portions that could be recreated were taken from the Google cache below; BuzzFeed cannot guarantee the sentences appear in the exact order as The New York Times intended to them to be. Update Several hours after this story was posted the New York Times republished their story. A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement: \"Our editors decide when a story is ready for publication. Outside coverage does not play a role in that decision,\" according to Dylan Byers of Politico. Anthony Weiner responding to the New York Times in an interview with City and State said \"I want to reiterate that sense of apology, and I have never talked about the private exchanges that we have had and I never will, because I think that they have already been put through enough.\" <doc_sep> Customers taunt Lisa Weiss. \"Talk dirty to me,\" they joke. \"We know you like it.\" Colleagues refuse to speak with her. Strangers mock her in nasty online messages. \"Clearly she is got mental issues,\" declared the latest. Anthony D. Weiner's improbable campaign for mayor of New York City is a wager that voters have made peace with his lewd online behavior, a subject he has largely left behind as he roils the race with his aggressive debating style and his attention-getting policy proposals. But for the women who were on the other end of Mr. Weiner's sexually explicit conversations and photographs, his candidacy is an unwanted reminder of a scandal that has upended their lives in ways big and small, cutting short careers, disrupting educations and damaging reputations. \"I cannot tell you the devastation,\" said Ms. Weiss, a 42-year-old blackjack dealer in Nevada who exchanged dozens of explicit messages with Mr. Weiner, then a congressman, in 2010 and 2011. Ms. Weiss, a die-hard Democrat who once volunteered for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and was inspired by \"Fahrenheit 9 11,\" a film critique of the Bush administration, said she had reached out to Mr. Weiner after watching him joust with Republican rivals on cable news. They traded admiring messages on Facebook that, at his prompting, became intimate and raunchy, she said. When their correspondence eventually became public, she said in an interview, conservative-minded colleagues sought to have her fired. The press lined up outside of her house and showed up at her casino, causing her to miss work for weeks. One night, she turned on the television to find the HBO host Bill Maher and the actress Jane Lynch performing a dramatic reading of the bawdy messages. Ms. Weiss, an avowed Maher fan, said she sat in her living room crying. While coping with the onslaught, she drank heavy amounts of alcohol, a habit that persists. \"I obsess about it,\" she said, \"every day.\" It is hard not to, she said: Mr. Weiner had faded from view after resigning from Congress, but now that he is in the mayoral race, her phone lights up with calls from reporters, online enemies are pouncing and fresh cruelties abound. \"We know what you want to do to him,\" she recalled a man teasing her at work recently. Little unites the five women whose online relationships with Mr. Weiner have become public. Some were self-confident political admirers; some were struggling and insecure, flattered by attention from a man in power. Some fled publicity after his downfall; some sought it out. Ms. Weiss even appeared on \"Inside Edition.\" Some of them still think he would be a good mayor; some are repelled by the concept. But it is clear that all of them have been overwhelmed by the reaction to the imbroglio. Gennette Cordova, a 21-year-old college student when she interacted with Mr. Weiner, is still trying to reclaim her identity, online and off. In spring 2011, Mr. Weiner sent her an image of himself in boxers, with an obvious erection. Ms. Cordova, who has told The New York Times that she had chatted electronically with Mr. Weiner about politics and not about sex, was shocked by his unwanted advance. When Mr. Weiner inadvertently posted the image publicly on Twitter, the Internet quickly rendered its own verdict, branding Ms. Cordova, incorrectly, she says, a participant in his online dalliances. The news media dug up Ms. Cordova's old yearbooks and sifted through police records, publicizing her youthful indiscretions. The attention prompted her to withdraw from academic classes. She moved from Seattle to New York City, before Mr. Weiner's decision to run for mayor, eager to leave a place where she had become known for her ties to the unfolding drama. But, with Mr. Weiner back in the spotlight, the story has followed her across the country. A few weeks ago, a reporter showed up, unannounced, at her office, asking her about Mr. Weiner. The repercussions were also painful for Traci Nobles, a onetime schoolteacher and a fitness instructor in Georgia, who says her roommate leaked her salacious messages with Mr. Weiner without her permission. As media inquiries poured in to her employer, Ms. Nobles was forced to quit her job at a Young Women's Christian Organization because of the attention. \"Which sort of broke my heart,\" she has said in an interview. Determined to explain her online relationship with Mr. Weiner and its impact on her life, Ms. Nobles is writing a book that has yet to be published. The shared experience of the women involved has brought several of them together, for a kind of online group therapy. Ms. Weiss said she had discussed Mr. Weiner with both Ms. Nobles and Ms. Cordova. \"We all kind of commiserated,\" Ms. Weiss said. \"They were all very supportive.\" Asked about the fallout, Mr. Weiner said in a statement: \"I am deeply sorry that my behavior caused so much upheaval in the lives of those who were unwittingly involved.\" On the campaign trail, though, he mixes contrition with wittiness. Not long ago he cracked a joke about his use of social media. \"You know how much I trust Twitter,\" he said at a candidate forum. A number of the women remain angry with Mr. Weiner arguing that, after taking advantage of his political devotees, he is now drawing them back into the spotlight. Ginger Lee, a former star of adult films who communicated with Mr. Weiner online, has pleaded with him not to run for mayor. \"Every new headline and news story about him reminds reporters and bloggers that we exist, and the cycle starts all over,\" she said in a statement released by her lawyer. \"There will be a new flare-up of jokes, inaccurate statements and hurtful remarks.\" Ms. Weiss, who said she was a voluntary participant in explicit online chats with Mr. Weiner, said it was his position as a prominent lawmaker that allowed him to steer conversations about politics and policy into racy exchanges about sex. \"If he were a regular guy off the street talking to me like that,\" she said, \"I would have not done it.\" Ms. Weiss said her back-and-forth with Mr. Weiner was at times remarkably intimate and confessional. She recalled Mr. Weiner acknowledging loneliness when his wife, an aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton, traveled abroad. He once called Ms. Weiss and, after realizing that her 12-year-old niece was in the room, got on the phone with the girl to wish her good night. \"I was flattered,\" she said of their chats. Soon after Mr. Weiner confessed to his online indiscretions, Ms. Weiss's own troubles began. She said a former boyfriend threatened to make public her messages with Mr. Weiner. So she acted first, granting access to her Facebook account to a reporter at RadarOnline.com, a decision that she says was a result of her navet about the news media, and that she now regrets. \"I thought I could control it,\" she said. She could not. Hundreds of the messages appeared on Web sites and in newspapers across the country. The coverage even reached her 98-year-old grandmother. \"How do you explain that to everyone you know who reads that?\" Ms. Weiss asked. \"It was horrible.\" Her feelings about him now are complex, unsettled and somewhat counterintuitive. She acknowledges she brought on some of the damage herself, and even went on to his Facebook site to apologize. But she is heartened by his campaign for mayor and rooting for him to win, despite her travails. \"I would like him to say, 'I am sorry I put you in that position,'\" she said. But she added: \"If he lived here, I would vote for him. He is such a big fighter for all of our causes.\" Ms. Nobles, the Georgia fitness instructor, said she, too, understood the appeal of Mr. Weiner's candidacy, though she did not express outright support. \"A perfect comeback story, ya know?\" she wrote in an e-mail to The Times. Back at the casino, Ms. Weiss says she is trying to laugh off the crude jokes that she hears. But the words sting. \"It gets old after two years,\" she said.",
    "reference_summary": "Anthony Weiner may be moving on from his 2011 sexting scandal-but for the five women on the other end of his raunchy messages and photos, it is not so easy, the New York Times reports. Lisa Weiss, 42, says customers at the casino where she works as a blackjack dealer do not make it easy to forget, saying things like, \"Talk dirty to me,\" and, \"We know what you want to do to him,\" while colleagues refuse to speak to her, and strangers send her disparaging remarks online. \"Clearly she is got mental issues,\" read a recent one. Gennette Cordova, who was 21 when she received a photo of Weiner's, er, weiner, moved across the country to get away from the scandal, but the press still tracked her down, showing up at her new workplace. And Ginger Lee says his new mayoral campaign is a constant reminder of what happened. \"Every new headline and news story about him reminds reporters and bloggers that we exist, and the cycle starts all over,\" she says. \"There will be a new flare-up of jokes, inaccurate statements and hurtful remarks.\" Vaguely interesting side-note, Buzzfeed reported earlier today that this story was first published on June 10 then pulled offline. The Times then posted the story hours later, but says it was not influenced by the Buzzfeed piece.",
    "generated_summary": "Anthony Weiner's campaign for mayor of New York is a carefully calibrated wager that voters have made peace with his lewd online behavior, a seemingly victimless cybercrime for which his wife and family have forgiven him. But for the five women whose online relationships with the disgraced congressman have become public, it is hard not to obsess about it. \"I thought I could control it,\" Lisa Weiss, a blackjack dealer who exchanged explicit messages with Weiner in 2010 and 2011, tells the New York Times. \"We know what you want to do to him.\" The women, many of whom went public in exchange for cash, are portrayed as victims of a harsh media environment who have banded together in a shared struggle to reclaim their lives. \"This is the life of a Weiner Woman: infused with indignity, two years later,\" Weiss tells the Times. Weiss, an avowed Maher fan, said she sat in her living room crying. Hundreds of the messages appeared on Web sites and in newspapers across the country. The coverage even reached her 98-year-old grandmother. \"How do you explain that to everyone you know who reads that?\" Weiss asked. \"It was horrible.\"",

    "document": "CHAMPION, Wis. In France, the shrine at Lourdes is surrounded by hundreds of hotels and has received as many as 45,000 pilgrims in a single day. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico, draws millions of fervent worshipers a year. Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame. This month, it became one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary have been officially validated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1859, the year after Mary is said to have appeared in Lourdes, a Belgian immigrant here named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who hovered between two trees in a bright light, clothed in dazzling white with a yellow sash around her waist and a crown of stars above her flowing blond locks. As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. On December 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared \"with moral certainty\" that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters \"of a supernatural character\" that are \"worthy of belief.\" Lourdes-like hordes have not yet gathered, but since the weighty decree a growing stream of visitors, some driving several hours, has found its way here to pray and revel in what many say is the palpable presence of Mary. Calls are coming in from as far as New York from church groups that want to visit by the busload, and local church officials are wondering whether they thought too small when they built a new parking lot planned well before this month with 75 spaces. Debbie Banda, 46, and her mother, Mary Young, 75, who live nearby, learned of the shrine and the bishop's decision from the news, and came for the first time on Wednesday. \"It is incredible she is here, you just feel it,\" Ms. Banda said after praying in the crypt chapel, said to be on the spot of the apparitions. As they passed a statue of Mary in white, just as described by Ms. Brise, Ms. Banda was overcome with emotion, weeping and hugging her mother. The two of them went back to pray some more. \"We need the Virgin Mary's protection, and for her to keep an eye on our soldiers, too,\" said Ms. Young, whose sons have served in the Middle East. \"We will definitely be coming back.\" Catholic leaders described the decree in Wisconsin as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. \"This is a gift to the believers,\" said the Rev. Johann Roten, director of the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton. \"It would be devious to say that this was somehow pulled out of the attic to exorcise the problems of the church today,\" Father Roten said in a telephone interview. \"But hopefully this will have a beneficial impact on the people, showing them that there are ways of living with faith that are very pure.\" The Diocese of Green Bay is under fire from lawyers in an abuse-related lawsuit, who charge that it has obstructed justice by destroying potentially incriminating files on former priests. The diocese says it has cooperated fully with law enforcement and discarded psychiatric records of deceased priests as required by federal privacy laws. Bishop Ricken, in an interview at his office in Green Bay, noted that the church has a tradition of taking its time with such cases. Over the years, he said, his predecessors had implicitly endorsed the shrine by holding services there and encouraging people to visit. When he moved to Green Bay in 2008, he said, \"I was struck by how many stories I heard of answered prayers\" resolved family and employment problems as well as medical cures and he decided to start a formal investigation. \"People have a hunger for the spiritual, and right here in our backyard was a source to meet that need,\" Bishop Ricken said. The church's scandals did not influence his decision, he said, but if the shrine can become a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, \"that would be beautiful.\" The Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops. Wary of fraud, the church is generally reluctant even to investigate claims. Over the 20th century, some 386 major apparitions of Mary were reported at a level beyond local rumors, said Father Roten, who has been an investigator in purported sightings. About 75 of those were studied, and at most a dozen were recognized as valid, he said. Increasingly, he said, the church makes use of psychiatric examinations and brain scans to see if people making claims are mentally healthy and not having hallucinations. That kind of examination was not possible, of course, for Ms. Brise, and Bishop Ricken said that his panel of three theological specialists had considered a host of indirect factors in concluding that her sighting was credible, following guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978. By all reports, he said, Ms. Brise was humble and honest and faithfully carried out Mary's mandate to serve the church throughout her life. In one striking sign of a divine presence, he said, the shrine's grounds and the terrified crowd who gathered there were spared the flames of the Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871, which devoured the surrounding lands and homes and caused more than 1,200 deaths. Her account of Mary's apparition and message was consistent with accepted cases. The dozens of families and individuals who stopped to pray at the shrine on Wednesday afternoon seemed to have no doubts at all about the apparitions. \"There is a lot of power here,\" said Theresa Vandermause, 45, who for years has made a weekly pilgrimage to the shrine with her friend Judy Deprey, 65. \"You can feel the presence of Mary, and it feels like she is listening to you.\" The two women were pleased that the church had finally declared Mary's visits here to be real, but said that the decree had not really changed anything. \"We knew that already!\" they declared. <doc_sep> In 1859 our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, visited the young woman, Adele Brise. It was an unlikely visitation to a simple, humble country girl on a dirt road in the wooded countryside. Her instruction was seemingly simple but required the commitment of Adele's life's work: teach the children in the faith. When we pause to think about this, it is very profound. The Holy Mother did not appear in a crowded city or to people of wealth and power. Instead, she appeared to an unlikely person in an unlikely place. In doing so, she made it clear to all the world that there is no one anywhere who is beyond the reach of God's generous love. This is good news. And now it is both our obligation and privilege to pay it forward by celebrating that visit and opening that message to anyone and everyone who answers the call.

A tiny chapel 17 miles northeast of Green Bay, Wisc., called Our Lady of Good Hope joins the likes of Mexico's Our Lady of Guadalupe and France's shrine at Lourdes, both of which draw millions each year.

    "document": "About The Ig Nobel Prizes The Ig Nobel Prizes honor achievements that make people LAUGH, and then THINK. The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology. Every September, in a gala ceremony in Harvard's Sanders Theatre, 1100 splendidly eccentric spectators watch the new winners step forward to accept their Prizes. These are physically handed out by genuinely bemused genuine Nobel Laureates. Thousands more, around the world, watch our live online broadcast. CEREMONY: The 29th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony will happen on Thursday, September 12, 2019, at Sanders Theatre, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Tickets will go on sale in July exclusively from the Harvard Box Office. LATEST NEWS: For recent bits of Ig Nobel news, see the Ig Nobel portion of our blog. PAST CEREMONIES: The 28th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony happened on Thursday, September 13, 2018. Videos of this and many other past ceremonies are archived on our YouTube channel and in the web pages devoted to each individual ceremony year. \"Last, but not least, there are the Ig Nobel awards. These come with little cash, but much cachet, and reward those research projects that 'first make people laugh, and then make them think'\" Nature \"It is like the weirdest f-ing thing that you will ever go to. it is a collection of, like, actual Nobel Prize winners giving away prizes to real scientists for doing f'd-up things. it is awesome.\"- Amanda Palmer Find videos and other details regarding past ceremonies on our Archive page Stay informed about upcoming Ig Nobel eventsjoin our private E-mail list.

The winners page contains a complete list. The Ig Archive page collects details, videos, and links from past ceremonies. What about the Ig Informal Lectures? At the ceremony itself, the new winners are given only 60 seconds to explain themselves. So. two days later, on Saturday afternoon, we give them considerably more time, plus a projector, so they can explain themselves and their research more fully, and discuss details with the audience. Of course! For details on how the nomination process works, please read here Almost always, we contact the chosen individuals or teams in advance, quietly, to offer the prize and give them the option to decline this great honor. If someone declines, we simply, privately withdraw the offer. Happily, nearly everyone who is offered an Ig Nobel Prize decides to accept, and also decides to come be part of the ceremony. -No. We are honoring achievements that make people laugh, then think. Good achievements can also be odd, funny, and even absurd; So can bad achievements. A lot of good science gets attacked because of its absurdity. A lot of bad science gets revered despite its absurdity. Yes. At every Ig Nobel Prize ceremony, genuine Nobel Laureates physically hand out the prizes, and participate in the ceremony in other ways.

That is because it was awarded \"for solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested,\" explained Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research This is not your typical scientific gig. In a room packed with Nobel laureates, opera singers, and whizzing paper airplanes, this could only be one event: the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. This marks the 26th year of the contest that celebrates scientific studies that \"make you laugh, and then think.\" Just like the 10 trillion prize accepted on stage by the winning scientists-it is a Zimbabwean banknote with little value as a result of hyperinflation-many of this year's studies focused on perception and deception. Take for example the Ig Nobel Prize-winning study of itches by a team of neurologists and psychologists at the University of Lbeck in Germany, published in PLOS ONE in 2013. The researchers injected a chemical under the skin of people's arms to cause a mild itch. The volunteers were then asked to scratch one of their arms while looking at themselves in a mirror. The catch was that the mirror and a real-time video camera controlled which arm appeared to be scratched. Sometimes the participants scratched the truly itchy arm but it looked like their nonitchy arm was being scratched, and vice versa. And surprisingly, the subjects reported significant itch relief even when they scratched the wrong arm-as long as it looked like the itchy arm was getting scratched. Misperception in the nonhuman world also got the Ig Nobel nod. Two studies of confused animals led by Gbor Horvth, a biophysicist at Etvs Lornd University in Budapest, garnered a joint prize. The first was a study of dragonflies published in 2007 in Freshwater Biology The mystery was why dragonflies were spending so much time on polished black gravestones in Hungarian cemeteries where the insects' prey were nowhere to be found. The females were even depositing their eggs on the stone surface where they had no chance of surviving. The answer? Polarized light. The insects detect their watery homes by looking for the polarized light that shimmers on its surface. It turns out that the black gravestones reflect similar polarized light, turning them into a literal graveyard for dragonflies. Then Horvth turned to the mystery of horse flies. Why do they prefer to bite dark horses over white ones? In a study published in 2010 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B he discovered the answer: Polarized light strikes again. Horses with pure white fur are much prized by breeders and suffer a range of maladies-including sunburn-but they have a built-in advantage. White horse fur does not reflect the characteristic polarized light that the blood-sucking insects use to find their lunch. But perhaps the ultimate exploration of animal confusion goes to Charles Foster and Thomas Thwaites. Foster is an ethicist and veterinarian based in Oxford, YOU.K.; Thwaites is a technologist based in London, and both of them have spent significant amounts of time pretending to not be humans. Foster, who wanted to better understand the nonhuman \"worldview,\" lived for days at a time as a badger, sleeping all day and roaming the forest all night on his hands and knees hunting for earthworms to eat. The animal of choice for Thwaites was an elephant, but he deemed it too dangerous and difficult of a transformation, so he settled on being a goat. This required the design of prosthetic limbs and intense physical training. He spent days with goats in the Swiss Alps, chewing grass and generally trying to fit in with the herd. What did he learn from his immersive exploration of the goat world? It is crucial to have friends in the intensely hierarchical world of the herd, and Thwaites says he was lucky to have a goat \"buddy.\" All their hard work paid off last night as they accepted their 10 trillion prizes. The rest of the 2016 Ig Nobel Prizes: REPRODUCTION PRIZE The late Ahmed Shafik of Cairo University, for studying the effects of wearing polyester, cotton, or wool trousers on the sex life of rats, and for then conducting similar tests with human males. ECONOMICS PRIZE Mark Avis, Sarah Forbes, and Shelagh Ferguson, for assessing the perceived personalities of rocks, from a sales and marketing perspective. PSYCHOLOGY PRIZE Evelyne Debey, Maarten De Schryver, Gordon Logan, Kristina Suchotzki, and Bruno Verschuere, for asking a thousand liars how often they lie, and for deciding whether to believe those answers. PEACE PRIZE Gordon Pennycook, James Allan Cheyne, Nathaniel Barr, Derek Koehler, and Jonathan Fugelsang for their scholarly study called \"On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit.\" LITERATURE PRIZE Fredrik Sjberg, for his three-volume autobiographical work about the pleasures of collecting flies that are dead, and flies that are not yet dead. PERCEPTION PRIZE Atsuki Higashiyama and Kohei Adachi, for investigating whether things look different when you bend over and view them between your legs. <doc_sep> Nobel winning scientists gather for 26th straight year to award the most absurd, strange and curious research of the year Investigations into rats wearing pants, the personalities of rocks and the truthfulness of 1,000 liars won Ig Nobel prizes on Thursday night at Harvard, where Nobel-winning scientists gathered to honor the strangest research of the year. 2015 Ig Nobel prizes: dinosaur-like chickens and bee-stings to the penis Read more The ceremony, now in its 26th year, delivered a 10tn Zimbabwean bill about 40 cents in US money to winners. Those who traveled to Boston received their prizes from Nobel laureates: chemist Dudley Herschbach, economist Eric Maskin, Dr Rich Roberts and physicist Roy Glauber. As in past years, the tone of the awards show vacillated from gleeful absurdism to satire to genuine wonder at the lengths to which scientists will let their curiosity lead them. Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik, for instance, wanted to know the toll that trousers might take on male rats. He made murine trousers covering the animals' hind legs with a hole for the tail in various cloths: 100 polyester, 50 50 polyester cotton, all cotton and all wool. Rats that wore polyester showed \"significantly lower\" rates of sexual activity, Shafik found, perhaps because of the electrostatic charges created by the material. Cotton- and wool-wearing rats were relatively normal. Mark Avis, Sarah Forbes and Shelagh Ferguson, a team from New Zealand and the UK, won the prize in economics for a study of the personalities of rocks. The trio studied a concept called \"brand personality\", or the \"set of human characteristics associated with the brand\" for example wholesomeness, youth, intelligence and sophistication by putting pictures of rocks in front of 225 Kiwi students. The students then decided which of 42 traits, 15 facets and five factors to apply to the rocks in question. One, Rock G, was variously described as \"a big New York type businessman, rich, smooth, maybe a little shady\" and \"carries a black brief case, slick hair, quick thinker and quicker talker. Not a good dude though.\" Rock I was described by one student as \"a gypsy or a traveller, a hippie\" and by another as \"liberal, attractive and female, I saw a young person, maybe mid-30s, who was very attractive when she was younger possibly a model. Has her own way of thinking, with a somewhat grounded confidence, enjoys organic food.\" The third rock, Rock H, was called \"modest\", \"farm mechanic\" and \"down-to-earth\". The biology award went to two Britons: Thomas Thwaites, who created prosthetic limbs that let him move like and among goats, and Charles Foster, who has tried to live as a badger, an otter, a fox and a stag. As a badger, Foster ate worms, dug a hillside den and tried to sniff out voles. Living as an urban fox, he scavenged through trash and slept in gardens. As a goat, Thwaites infiltrated a herd in the Swiss Alps and spent three days eating grass, bleating and stumbling over rocks. Foster and Thwaites wrote books about their experiments, respectively Being a Beast and GoatMan. A coalition from the US, Canada, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands won the psychology award, for asking 1,000 liars how often they had lied over the course of their life, and rating how well they lied. People gradually lied more as they aged out of childhood, the study found, peaking during adolescence, and as adults lied on average twice a day. Lying decreased with age, although some prolific liars may have skewed results. The researchers also acknowledged that the liars might have been lying to them all along. The peace prize went to a gang of philosophers from Canada and the US who published a paper titled On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit. The researchers studied how people understand gibberish that has been framed as if it means something, by creating random but grammatical sentences of buzzwords that sounded like vaguely meditative posters meant to inspire office drones or distract dental patients from the drill. Examples included \"wholeness quiets infinite phenomena\" and \"hidden meaning transforms unparalleled abstract beauty\". \"There is little question that bullshit is a real and consequential phenomenon,\" the scientists wrote, warning that given advances in communication, \"bullshit may be more pervasive than ever before\". They noted, for example, that Dr Deepak Chopra, an author and MD followed by millions on Twitter, once wrote: \"Attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation.\" Their mission: \"Are people able to detect blatant bullshit? Who is most likely to fall prey to bullshit and why?\" The philosophers asked 280 students at the University of Waterloo to rate the \"profoundness\" of real and invented statements on a scale of one to five, and to search for meaning in those statements. Those students most \"receptive to bullshit\", they found, were \"less reflective, lower in cognitive ability\" and more likely \"to hold religious and paranormal beliefs\". The researchers admitted their study had limitations, writing: \"Although this manuscript may not be truly profound, it is indeed meaningful.\" A medicine prize was given to German scientists who found that if you have an itch on your left side, you can look into a mirror and scratch your right to relieve it. A perception prize was handed to two Japanese researchers who tried to learn whether bending over and looking at things between your legs changes how things appear. Physics awards were given to researchers from Hungary, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, who found that white horses attract fewer horseflies and that dragonflies are fatally attracted to black tombstones. The award for literature went to a Swedish author, Fredrik Sjoberg, who wrote a trilogy about collecting flies. The most surprising winner was for chemistry: the automaker Volkswagen, caught for violating US emissions law, was granted a nearly worthless Zimbabwean bill to help pay for its massive legal costs. The Ig Nobel committee said the award was \"for solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electro-mechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested\". <doc_sep> Image copyright TIM BOWDITCH Image caption Mr Thwaites found that he soon developed \"friends\" A British man who lived in the Alps as a goat for three days has won one of this year's Ig Nobel prizes. Tom Thwaites had special prostheses made so he could walk like an animal. The spoof awards, which are not quite as famous as the real Nobels, were handed out during their annual ceremony at Harvard University, US. Other studies honoured during the event examined the personalities of rocks, and how the world looks when you bend over and view it through your legs. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thomas Thwaites: 'I tried to take a holiday from being a human being by being a goat' On the surface, all the celebrated research sounds a bit daft, but a lot of it when examined closely is actually intended to tackle real-world problems. And nearly all of the science gets published in peer-reviewed, scholarly journals. It is unlikely, though, that the German carmaker Volkswagen will appreciate the point or humour of the Ig Nobels. The firm has been awarded the chemistry prize for the way it cheated emissions tests.

Clearly, the practice is fast-becoming a national trait. Mr Thwaites concedes his effort was initially an attempt to escape the stress of modern living, but then became a passion. He spent a year researching the idea, and even persuaded an expert in prostheses, Dr Glyn Heath at Salford University, to build him a set of goat legs.

He developed a strong bond with one animal in particular a \"goat buddy\", but also very nearly kicked off a big confrontation at one point. \"I was just sort of walking around, you know chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realised that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which I had not kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and I think I was about to get in a fight,\" he told BBC News. The American science humour magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research, is the inspiration behind the Ig Nobels, which are now in their 26th year. Thursday night's ceremony was reportedly as chaotic as ever, with audience members throwing the obligatory paper planes while real Nobel laureates attempted to hand out the prizes.

In front of a rowdy crowd, real Nobel winners handed out the awards to those who had the year's oddest research. Winners also received 10 trillion-in a single Zimbabwean banknote US value: less than 1 Some highlights from the annual ceremony at Harvard University, which was presented by the Annals of Improbable Research: \"Goat man\" Tom Thwaites wore his goat legs to the awards ceremony .He tells the BBC that he gained a \"goat buddy\" during his time in the Alps-but there were some tense moments. \"I was just sort of walking around, you know, chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realized that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which I had not kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and I think I was about to get in a fight,\" he says. Thwaites shared the biology prize with Charles Foster, another Brit who has spent time living in the wild as, among other things, a badger, an otter, and a fox. Science reports that the medicine prize went to a team of neurologists and psychologists, who, with the help of video cameras, mirrors, and volunteers injected with a chemical that causes a mild itch, discovered that scratching the left side of your body will relieve an itch on the right side if you are looking in a mirror at the time. A Japanese team won the perception prize with a study published as \"Perceived Size and Perceived Distance of Targets Viewed From Between the Legs: Evidence for Proprioceptive Theory.\" Their research involved bending over and looking at things from between their legs to see if they looked any different. Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik was posthumously awarded the reproduction prize for his research on how wearing trousers of polyester, cotton, or wool affected the sex lives of rats. The rats that wore polyester had the biggest drop in sexual activity, notes the Guardian. This year's Ig Nobel in chemistry went to Volkswagen, for \"solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested.\" Previous Ig Nobels have gone to scientists who swallowed parboiled dead shrews and a researcher who allowed bees to sting every part of his anatomy.",

    "document": "MORE VIDEO Arrest made in Midwest City disappearance case Palma now in Oklahoma County Jail Midwest City Police think they have had a break in an 18-year-old homicide case. On Tuesday FOX 25 learned more about the man police say kidnapped and murdered a young girl. 56-year-old Anthony Palma is now in police custody. Kirsten Hatfield was kidnapped out of her bedroom window in her Midwest City home in 1997. That home is located on Jet Drive, near S.E. 15th and Air Depot Blvd. Police found her ripped panties with blood on them left on the window sill of her bedroom. She has not been heard from since and police never made an arrest until now. \"We want to take this opportunity to let all of our family and friends know that we are OK and please continue to pray for us,\" said Kirsten's step-father Chris Hazen. Hazen along with Kirsten's mom Shannon say they are tired but hopeful this nightmare they have been living in for 18 years could soon be over. \"We have worked continuously on this case for 18 years,\" said Midwest City Police Chief Brandon Clabes. \"We are emotionally invested in this case.\" Midwest City Police revealed in a press conference on Tuesday that DNA evidence links Palma to Kirsten's disappearance. The connection comes from evidence taken the day Kirsten was taken. Police kept cigarettes, a syringe, a beer bottle and blood found on both Kirsten's panties and her windowsill. Police say none of that evidence was DNA tested and could say why it was not. \"We are realizing more and more as technology advances, we see the ability to conduct more sensitive testing,\" said OSBI director Stan Florence. With the DNA in hand, Midwest City Police tracked down at least ten men associated with the case and re-interviewed them and obtained their DNA samples. In July of 2015, the OSBI revealed the DNA from the scene and Palma's DNA matched. Police arrested Palma this past Monday night. \"This is the initial stage of this case,\" said Chief Clabes. \"We have a lot more work to do in reference to this case.\" Police are confident that Palma killed Kirsten, but her body has never been located. Her family is hoping that is the next step in this investigation. \"I wanted to say thank you to all the police, law enforcement that is helping solve this case because it is just been a terrible nightmare to my wife ever since it happened,\" Hazen said. Palma will be tranported to the Oklahoma County Jail. He faces charges of kidnapping and first degree murder. <doc_sep> An arrest has been made in the case of Kirsten Hatfield, who went missing in 1997. KOCO learned Monday that Anthony Palma had been arrested in connection with her disappearance after 18 years of investigation.

READ: Affidavit released in Midwest City cold case According to court documents, on July 22, a DNA sample matching Palma was found in evidence collected in 1997. The match came after items were sent to OSBI for testing that had not been tested before, according to the court documents. Investigators said they believe Palma targeted Hatfield for sexual assault. They said evidence supported that claim, including his blood being on her partially ripped underwear and her window sill. Video: Authorities discuss arrest in investigation of Midwest City's girl's disappearance \"It is proverbial needle in a haystack how fortunate, lucky we were in this case,\" Midwest City Police Chief Brandon Clabes said. Police said because Hatfield has not been sighted since 1997, it can be concluded that she was killed shortly after her abduction. Hatfield went missing on May 14, 1997. Midwest City police said evidence indicated that she had been taken from her bedroom window. Police said the trail went cold, but on June 13, 2015, an officer was assigned to follow up on the cold case. The officer said he went through all the evidence previously collected and decided to re-submit some evidence for testing. The investigators continued working the case and said they collected DNA from all men they interviewed. On June 1, investigators said they interviewed Palma, who was also interviewed twice in 1997. The investigators said his interview was inconsistent with information gathered in 1997. Officers said Palma's DNA match to evidence found at the scene was one in 293 sextillion. Video: Midwest City neighborhood where girl was kidnapped continues to be at center of investigation Midwest City police are continuing to investigate the case, and say there could possibly be additional suspects. Investigators said Palma had been under their surveillance for some time.

Anthony Joseph Palma, 56, was arrested Monday at his home in the town of Midwest City just two homes down the street from the house Kirsten's family was living in when she vanished in May 1997. He was being held without bond on suspicion of first-degree murder and kidnapping. Kristin is still missing but her family was \"hopeful\" and \"grateful\" for news of the arrest, said Chris Hazen, the current husband of Kirsten's mother, Shannon.

National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \"We are OK,\" Hazen said, according to NBC station KFOR of Oklahoma City. \"This has just been a terrible nightmare to my wife ever since it happened.\" The break in the case came when it was reassigned in June to Midwest City police Detective Darrell Miller. According to an arrest warrant affidavit filed Monday in Oklahoma County District Court, Miller requested FBI assistance in reviewing all of the old evidence and discovered that several key pieces most notable among them bloodstains on Kirsten's underwear, which was found in the backyard, and on her bedroom windowsill either went untested or came back inconclusive because the technology to test it at the time was limited.

Midwest City, Oklahoma, Police Department via AP The State Bureau of Investigation's crime lab found a DNA match to Palma in July, putting its odds of certainty at 263 sextillion to 1, according to the affidavit. \"The evidence shows that Kirsten may have been targeted by Palma for sexual assault,\" Miller wrote in the affidavit. \"It is likely that Palma has been motivated to stay in the same home to conceal evidence of the crime and or the location of Kristen's body.\" State corrections records show that Palma who has lived at the same Midwest City address since 1991 was convicted of assault and or battery with a dangerous weapon in the early 1980s and was released from prison in 1986.

This May 20, 2013 arrest photo made available by the Broward County Sheriff's Office shows former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson. Johnson will serve 30 days in jail after violating probation in a domestic. Associated Press FILE In this August 12, 2012 file photo, Chad Johnson, center, leaves Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Johnson will serve 30 days in jail after violating probation in a domestic violence. Associated Press Johnson, known as Chad Ochocinco for his jersey number in Spanish during his playing days, had reached a deal with prosecutors calling for community service and counseling instead of jail. Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh said she would tack on an additional three months' probation because Johnson had failed to meet with his probation officer during three previous months. It was all set until Johnson, when asked by McHugh if he was satisfied with his lawyer Adam Swickle, gave the attorney a light swat on the rear _ as football players routinely do to each other on the field. The courtroom erupted in laughter and at that McHugh said she would not accept the deal. \"I do not know that you are taking this whole thing seriously. I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?\" McHugh said, slapping the plea deal document down on her desk. \"The whole courtroom was laughing. I am not going to accept these plea negotiations. This is not a joke.\" Johnson, 35, tried to apologize and insisted he meant no disrespect. Johnson was on probation after pleading no contest to head-butting his then-wife, TV reality star Evelyn Lozada, during an altercation last August. She quickly filed for divorce after barely a month of marriage and Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, was immediately released by the Miami Dolphins. He did not play at all last season. \"This is your courtroom. I have no intent to make this a joke. It is not funny,\" Johnson told the judge \"My life is in a shambles right now and I try my best to laugh and keep a smile on my face.\" But McHugh, who could have given Johnson up to a year in jail, was not moved. \"It is not the first time he is behaved that way in my courtroom,\" she said. Johnson then was handcuffed and hauled away to jail. Swickle declined comment on whether he would seek a reduced sentence. Johnson has been undergoing therapy aimed at helping people involved in domestic violence but has not signed with another NFL team. He said in court Monday he hoped that would change in the upcoming football season, but now faces another setback. \"He has suffered. He has lost everything,\" Swickle told the judge. Johnson, whose best playing days were with the Cincinnati Bengals, caught 766 passes for more than 11,000 yards and 67 touchdowns during his career. He also played for the New England Patriots. Lozada stars on VH-1's\"Basketball Wives\" TV show. She was previously engaged to ex-NBA star Antoine Walker, who played for the Miami Heat, Boston Celtics and other teams, and was a star on the University of Kentucky's 1996 national championship team. _ Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http: twitter.com Miamicurt",

    "document": "Abu Omar says Sabrina De Sousa, who faces extradition to Italy, is a scapegoat and the real culprits are more senior officials The radical Egyptian cleric who was kidnapped in Milan by the CIA in 2003 has come to the defence of a former CIA officer convicted for her alleged role in his extraordinary rendition. Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, who is known as Abu Omar, told the Guardian in a telephone interview that he believed Sabrina De Sousa, who faces imminent extradition to Italy, was a scapegoat and ought to be pardoned by Italy's head of state, Sergio Mattarella. De Sousa, a 60-year-old dual American and Portuguese citizen, faces a four-year prison sentence and is due to be extradited from Portugal on 4 May. \"Sabrina and the others who were convicted are scapegoats. The US administration sacrificed them. All of those higher up in the hierarchy are enjoying their immunity,\" he said. \"These people higher up, without doubt they should be convicted in this case. They should face trial.\" The remarks mark an extraordinary turn of events in a story that has vexed the US and Italian governments since Abu Omar's case became public in 2005, exposing in great detail the inner workings of a highly classified and controversial Bush-era counter-terrorism programme. The case also exposed US allies' help in conducting the secret programme. Abu Omar's views on De Sousa were first reported by ADNKronos, a wire agency. Abu Omar's story began on 18 February 2003 when he was stopped on a street in Milan, grabbed from behind and pulled inside a car by CIA officers, allegedly working with the help of Italian officials. The radical cleric, who had been granted political asylum in Italy in 2001 and was already the subject of a terrorism investigation by other Italian officials, leading to his eventual conviction in absentia, was then transported to Cairo via Germany, where he was allegedly imprisoned, interrogated and tortured. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Abu Omar was stopped on a street in Milan, grabbed from behind and pulled inside a car by CIA officers. Photograph: Nasser Nasser AP The case was investigated by an independent prosecutor in Italy, leading to the conviction in 2009 of 22 CIA operatives and other US officials for orchestrating the kidnapping. The US officials, including De Sousa, who was publicly a state department official in Milan but actually an undercover CIA officer, were convicted in absentia as they had left Italy before the trial began. Some officials, including Italians, were later pardoned. The US did not invoke diplomatic immunity for De Sousa or other low level officials. The story was dormant for years, largely because successive Italian governments steered clear of the issue and never sought to extradite any of the Americans involved. But that changed the moment De Sousa decided to leave the US last year and travel to Portugal to visit family. She was detained at the airport in Lisbon on her way to India because of an outstanding European arrest warrant that had been issued by law enforcement officials. De Sousa has always said she played a minor role as a translator in an early-stage discussion of extraordinary rendition, before Abu Omar had been named as a potential target. In the Guardian interview, Abu Omar said he was not sure whether she played a role, but that he had never seen her before. He said: \"Now she is 60 years old. If media reports are right, she and the people who kidnapped me were the reason why I left my job in Italy, and a lot of trouble to me and my family happened because of that. They are the reason behind my physical disabilities now. The Italian prosecution actually accused her of this.\" Whatever her involvement, he added: \"She is threatened to be sentenced between four and six years, and I do not wish that for her. I have been in prison before, and I do not wish for the same to happen to her, either as a friend or a foe. Especially because she is a woman.\" He pointed out that De Sousa had been on her way to visit her 90-year-old mother in India, and that he had been forbidden from paying respects to his own late mother after Egypt's interior minister at the time refused to release him from jail. He refused for me to attend my own mother's funeral, and Sabrina could be subjected to the same problem,\" he said. \"As a Muslim, I should wish for her to be pardoned.\" Italy condemned for its role in abduction of Egyptian imam in 2003 Read more He insisted that hers was a humanitarian case, because she \"exposed injustices and revealed the injustices through the media\". De Sousa has been a consistent critic of the US government and made a series of allegations in 2013, including that the former CIA station chief Jeffrey Castelli had exaggerated the threat Abu Omar posed to get approval for the rendition, and that the operation had been approved by the then CIA director George Tenet. In a recent interview with the Guardian she suggested she would willingly have discussions with Italian officials in order to defend herself. De Sousa said in response to the Abu Omar comments that she appreciated his remarks about her family. \"Abu Omar also recognises that my imprisonment will not result in real accountability for what he went through in Egypt,\" she said. De Sousa has said she knows the US government actively lobbied Italy's president, Mattarella, to pardon two CIA officials who were shown leniency late last year, even though they never served time in Italy. The former CIA officer's predicament comes at an exceedingly tricky moment for the Italian government. \"The US has been between a rock and a hard place on this for some time and now Italy is poised to wedge themselves in as well,\" said Chris Jenks, director of the Criminal Justice Clinic and an assistant law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law, who has followed the case. A move by Mattarella to pardon De Sousa would be politically problematic in Italy given the country's ongoing stand-off with Egypt over the recent torture and murder of an Italian citizen, Giulio Regeni, in Cairo. Americans, he added, were generally perceived as being unaccountable in matters of justice in Italy, from cases ranging from the 1998 Cavalese cable car disaster, when 20 people were killed after four American pilots accidentally cut a cable supporting a gondola but never faced prosecution, to the case of Amanda Knox, who was found not guilty of murder last year after a contentious murder trial. \"The Obama administration inherited this debacle and cannot publicly support what the CIA did in Milan. At the same time the US, like all countries, needs an intelligence service and President Obama does not want his legacy to be as allowing the first ever extradition of a CIA agent,\" Jenks said. Underscoring the point, the conservative Wall Street Journal published an editorial this week that criticised the White House for failing to protect De Sousa, saying Washington had \"abandoned one of its operatives to the political whims of foreign prosecutors\" and that her case sent a \"demoralising message to all who serve in the shadows, even as the war on terror enters a dangerous new phase\". The US has refused to comment on the case. But one official told the Guardian that De Sousa had made a decision to break ties with the government when she moved to sue the US for not invoking diplomatic immunity to help her. Jenks said it would probably never be known how the US might try to incentivise Italy's president to \"make this go away\" but that Italy would probably leverage the situation to get something in return for a pardon. The issue could feasibly be discussed as early as Friday, when the US vice-president, Joe Biden, is due to meet Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in Rome. <doc_sep> A former CIA officer who was convicted for helping the agency abduct a terrorism suspect off the streets of Milan lost her extradition battle Wednesday and said she fears she will end up in an Italian prison while the YOU.S. government sits on the sidelines. Sabrina de Sousa was one of 26 American officials convicted in absentia for the \"extraordinary rendition\" by the CIA of Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, a radical Egyptian cleric, who later claimed Egyptian officials tortured him after being handed over by the YOU.S. spy agency in 2003. De Sousa's lawyers have for years tried to persuade Barack Obama's administration to support her. \"The YOU.S. government will not intervene because they do not want me implicating anyone else as I try to counter the charges against me,\" de Sousa told ABC News from Lisbon, Portugal, where she has spent the past year fighting extradition to Italy over the George W. Bush-era counterterrorism operation. \"It is prison when I get there. No one wants narrative changed,\" de Sousa said Wednesday. \"I am trying to keep calm for the sake of my family.\" When she was convicted in 2009, de Sousa told ABC News the YOU.S. government had \"abandoned and betrayed\" her and her colleagues. \"Clearly, we broke a law,\" she said then, \"and we are paying for the mistakes right now, whoever authorized and approved this.\" Khaled Desouki AFP Getty Images So far, the YOU.S. government has mostly stayed out the case, at least publicly, so this week de Sousa appealed directly to Rome penning an open letter to Pope Francis. \"Your holiness, you have spoken decisively about the CIA's rendition, detention and interrogation program. We need your holiness's voice now more than ever to keep this issue in the forefront for much needed discourse in the court of public opinion,\" de Sousa wrote to Francis Wednesday in the letter, provided to ABC News. In October 2014, Francis spoke out against torture, illegal detention and countries that allow for the illegal transport of detainees to detention centers where torture is practiced. \"As of today, my extradition from Portugal to Italy is underway. Italy has guaranteed Portugal that I will be notified of my sentence and have the opportunity to counter the charges against me. Whether that happens remains to be seen,\" she told the pontiff. Nasr has claimed he was innocent of the accusations of terrorism, but in 2013 was reportedly convicted in absentia by an Italian court of criminal association with the goal of terrorism and with aiding illegal emigration with the goal of terrorism. The radical imam said this April in an interview with The Guardian that de Sousa and her colleagues were \"scapegoats\" and should not be held accountable for his abduction or torture. Rather, the YOU.S. government should own up to it. De Sousa in the ABC News interview said she had long wished to respond to Francis' comments on the rendition, detention and interrogation program by CIA, \"and since my future is uncertain, I am doing it now.\" The CIA declined to comment for this report. Last month a representative for the State Department declined to comment on de Sousa's predicament as well, saying, \"We do not talk about extradition cases.\" ABC News' Lee Ferran contributed to this report. <doc_sep> Former CIA Officer Says She Is Set To Be Extradited To Italy Enlarge this image toggle caption Barbara L. Salisbury MCT via Getty Images Barbara L. Salisbury MCT via Getty Images A former CIA officer convicted in Italy of playing a role in a kidnapping under the agency's \"extraordinary rendition\" program said Wednesday that she will be extradited to Italy and sent to prison. Sabrina de Sousa was convicted in absentia by an Italian court along with 25 other Americans of the kidnapping of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar off the streets of Milan 13 years ago. The kidnapping was part of the CIA's \"extraordinary rendition\" program, under which, as The Associated Press puts it, \"terrorism suspects were kidnapped and transferred to centers where they were interrogated and tortured.\" The program was greatly expanded during the George W. Bush administration, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. De Sousa, who was working undercover for the CIA in Italy at the time of Abu Omar's kidnapping, denies personal involvement in the abduction. As NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reported last month, De Sousa says she and her son were on a school trip to the ski slopes in northern Italy, more than 150 miles from Milan, for the entire week during which Abu Omar was abducted. Of the 26 Americans convicted of the kidnapping, some have since been pardoned, Mary Louise says, and none have yet served time in jail. De Sousa appealed her conviction to Portugal's highest court, but the Constitutional Court said Tuesday that her appeal was rejected, the AP says. \"De Sousa says she is waiting to hear when she will be taken to Italy, where she faces a four-year sentence,\" Mary Louise reports. \"De Sousa has battled her conviction through lawyers in Washington D.C. in Italy, and in Portugal where she now lives.\" As Mary Louise reported last month, critics of De Sousa point out that if she had stayed in the YOU.S., \"the whole affair would very likely have gone quiet\": \"Instead, De Sousa, who holds both American and Portuguese passports, decided to tempt fate and travel to Europe, when she knew there was a Europol warrant for her arrest. \"Asked why, De Sousa says she became convinced her name would never be cleared unless she forced the issue. She also says she has close family in Europe, including cousins and a sibling. 'As you get older, family becomes more important,' she says. 'While some people may think I did something really stupid, I just, you know, this was important to me.' In an email Wednesday, De Sousa told NPR it is her understanding that she will be heading straight to prison in Italy but that she hopes for some sort of appeal, Mary Louise reports. De Sousa wrote, \"I hope I am able to go to Italy safely, for the purpose of countering the charges against me, instead of being silenced.\" Italian President Sergio Mattarella has granted clemency to other defendants in this case, the AP reports. De Sousa said she wrote a letter to Pope Francis on Wednesday appealing for help. She writes:",

In 2003, the CIA abducted Egyptian cleric and terror suspect Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr from Milan, Italy, under its \"extraordinary rendition\" program. Nasr says he was transferred to Egypt, where he was tortured. At the time, Sabrina de Sousa was working undercover for the CIA in Italy but tells NPR she was 150 miles away on a ski trip with her son during the week Nasr was kidnapped. Nevertheless, de Sousa was one of 26 Americans convicted of violating Italian law by abducting Nasr. She faces four years in prison, the Guardian reports. De Sousa has been living in Portugal and fighting extradition-without any apparent help from the US government. \"The US government will not intervene because they do not want me implicating anyone else as I try to counter the charges against me,\" de Sousa tells ABC. She says she feels \"abandoned and betrayed\" by her own country. De Sousa appealed her extradition to Portugal's highest court but lost that appeal Wednesday.

    "document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Gordon Corera looks at why the Russian cyber plot sting was surprising Russian spies have been accused of involvement in a series of cyber-plots across the globe, leading the US to level charges against seven agents. The US justice department said targets included the global chemical weapons watchdog, anti-doping agencies and a US nuclear company. The allegations are part of an organised push-back against alleged Russian cyber-attacks around the world. Russia earlier dismissed the allegations as \"Western spy mania\". What is Russia accused of? The Netherlands has accused four Russians of plotting to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW which had been probing the chemical attack on a Russian ex-spy in the UK The UK government accused the GRU of being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks, whose targets included firms in Russia and Ukraine; the US Democratic Party; and a small TV network in the UK The US said its anti-doping agency, football's governing body Fifa and the US nuclear energy company Westinghouse were targeted by Russian intelligence Canada said \"with high confidence\" that breaches at its centre for ethics in sports and at the Montreal-based World Anti-Doping Agency were carried out by Russian intelligence Added to this, the Dutch authorities have said a laptop seized from the four suspects in April was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia. In Malaysia, the Netherlands said, it was used to target the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 over territory held by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed. A series of astonishing revelations by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The revelations about how the British and Dutch security agencies disrupted the operations of the GRU are astonishing in their detail and their openness. This is not what secretive intelligence agencies normally do. But the willingness of both countries to be so candid illustrates how determined both they and some other Western governments are to try to push back against what they see as a concerted pattern of Russian aggression. \"I imagine Mr Putin is shouting at one or two people right now,\" a cheerful British official told me. What has Russia said? Russia's foreign ministry which had earlier dismissed the allegations from the UK and the Netherlands as \"Western spy mania\" released an official statement late on Thursday, saying it was the victim of \"yet another stage-managed propaganda campaign\". \"It is unclear who is supposed to believe these statements accusing Russian citizens of attempting to mount cyber-attacks against the OPCW and trying to obtain data related to the Malaysian flight MH17, as if it is necessary to be near the target of your attack,\" it said. \"Any Russian citizen carrying a mobile device is seen as a spy,\" the statement added. What have the other countries said? John Demers, US Assistant Attorney General for National Security, told a press conference in Washington that many of the attacks were aimed at delegitimizing sports bodies and \"altering perceptions of the truth\". He said the attacks were how Russia retaliated for bans on its athletes following evidence it was systematically using drugs to enhance their performance. As a result of the findings, the US has indicted seven people, four of whom were the men expelled from the Netherlands, while the other three were among those charged in July with hacking Democratic officials during the 2016 US elections. Image copyright FBI Image caption The FBI released this \"wanted\" poster, naming and picturing the seven men They were also charged with wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering. All seven men are thought to be in Russia, which does not have an extradition treaty with the US. A joint statement from British Prime Minister Theresa May and her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte said the alleged plot against the OPCW demonstrated \"the GRU's disregard for global values and rules that keep us all safe\". Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK was discussing further sanctions against Russia with its allies. The EU has also denounced the alleged cyber-plots. What were the suspects doing in the Netherlands? The four suspects identified by Dutch officials had diplomatic passports which meant the Netherlands could not arrest them as diplomats are in theory immune from prosecution in their host country and included two IT experts and two support agents, officials said. The four hired a car and parked it in the car park of the Marriot hotel in The Hague, which is next to the OPCW office, to hack into the OPCW's wifi network, Major General Onno Eichelsheim from the Dutch MIVD intelligence service said. Image copyright Dutch Government Image caption The suspects were allegedly found to have specialist hacking equipment Equipment in the car boot was pointed at the OPCW and was being used to intercept login details, he said, adding that the antenna for the operation lay under a jacket on the car's rear shelf. Image copyright Ministrie van Defensie When the men were intercepted they tried to destroy one of the mobile phones they were carrying, Maj Gen Eichelsheim said. Image copyright Ministrie van Defensie He said one of their mobile phones was found to have been activated near the GRU building in Moscow, while another carried a receipt for a taxi journey from a street near the GRU to the airport. Maj Gen Eichelsheim said the group were planning to travel to Switzerland, to a laboratory in Spiez where the OPCW analysed samples. They never made it. Instead, the four were immediately escorted out of the country, he added. Who are the suspects? They were named by the MIVD as hackers Alexei Morenets and Yevgeny Serebriakov, and support agents Oleg Sotnikov and Alexei Minin. Image copyright Dutch Government Image caption Four suspects travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports earlier this year Officials said they were from the GRU's Unit 26165, which has also been known as APT 28. The UK's ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, said the unit had \"sent officers around the world to conduct brazen close access cyber-operations\" which involve hacking into wifi networks. He said the hackers were planning to travel on to the OPCW-certified laboratory in Spiez near Berne in Switzerland, where the Novichok nerve agent used in March's attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury was identified. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? At the time the Russian operation was disrupted, the OPCW was investigating the Skripal case as well as an alleged chemical attack in April on the Syrian town of Douma near Damascus by Russian-backed government forces, the MIVD said. \"With its aggressive cyber-campaigns, we see the GRU trying to clean up Russia's own mess be it the doping uncovered by Wada the World Anti-Doping Agency or the nerve agent identified by the OPCW,\" Mr Wilson said. What was on their computer? A laptop seized from the suspects was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia, the Dutch officials said. The cyber-operation in Malaysia targeted the attorney general's office and Malaysian police as well as the investigation into MH17's shooting down, Ambassador Wilson said. Earlier this year Dutch-led international investigators concluded that a missile that brought down MH17 belonged to a Russian brigade. Russia has denied any involvement in the plane's destruction, which led to the deaths of many Dutch citizens. Data from the laptop showed it was also present in the Swiss city of Lausanne where it was linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to Wada, which has exposed doping by Russian athletes. <doc_sep> A Russian cyber-attack on the headquarters of the international chemical weapons watchdog was disrupted by Dutch military intelligence just weeks after the Salisbury novichok attack, it emerged on Thursday, amid fresh revelations of spying that escalated the diplomatic war between the west and Vladimir Putin. The incident, which was thwarted with the help of British intelligence officials, came after the Sandworm cybercrime unit of the Russian military intelligence agency GRU had attempted unsuccessfully to hack the UK Foreign Office in March and the Porton Down chemical weapons facility in April. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said on Thursday that Moscow could face further sanctions as a result of an astonishingly detailed evidence trail laid out in the Netherlands, the UK and the US. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was now a \"pariah state\", while the Russian foreign ministry dismissed the allegations on Thursday night and claimed the west was gripped by \"spy mania\". Four Russian intelligence officers, believed to have been part of a GRU \"cleanup\" unit for earlier failed operations, travelled to The Hague on diplomatic passports in April after unsuccessfully launching a remote attack. At the time, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was investigating the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the UK, as well as a chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria. The British ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, said: \"With its aggressive cyber campaigns, we see the GRU trying to clean up Russia's own mess be it the doping uncovered by Wada the World Anti-Doping Agency or the nerve agent identified by the OPCW.\" The US government announced criminal charges against the intelligence officers for targeting the watchdog, including computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering to promote Russian interests by nefarious means. They were also charged, along with three more of their colleagues, with being part of the Fancy Bears group that hacked anti-doping authorities and leaked records of sports stars including Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Mo Farah at a time when Russia was facing allegations of state-sponsored cheating. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The passports of the four men apprehended by Dutch authorities. Photograph: Netherlands police The Russian spies were named by the Dutch authorities as cyber experts Evgenii Serebriakov, 37, and Aleksei Morenets, 41, as well as Oleg Sotnikov, and Alexey Minin, both 46, who provided human intelligence. They appeared to have made little attempt to hide their presence in the country, arriving together with Russian diplomatic passports at Schiphol airport, where they were captured on CCTV being met by a Russian embassy official. Once through customs and immigration controls, they hired a car and headed for The Hague. Senior British security officials said they were caught \"in flagrante\" by Dutch intelligence three days later, on 13 April, sitting in their hire car which was parked close to the OPCW building. They tried and failed to destroy their equipment and were immediately put on a plane back to Moscow. In the back of the vehicle, investigators found a laptop connected to a 4G mobile and a wifi panel antenna, partially hidden under a coat, as well as other specialist hacking equipment. They also recovered 20,000 and US 20,000 in cash, as well as taxi receipts from a GRU facility in Moscow and reconnaissance maps. Train tickets to Basel were also found, along with evidence of online searches for the Spiez lab, Switzerland's institute for nuclear, biological and chemical protection which had confirmed the British claim that the Skripals had been exposed to the military-grade nerve agent novichok. The manager of the Marriott hotel next door to the OPCW headquarters where the four alleged Russian spies were staying said they were seized without force and with \"no James Bond involved\". Vincent Pahlplatz told Associated Press the quartet were arrested by Dutch officers in broad daylight as they walked out of a lift. Senior British security officials said the same GRU \"close access\" unit had previously travelled to Malaysia to attempt to hack the investigation into Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which investigators have said was shot down by a Russian military missile, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board. They said the unit, known in the Russian military as 26165, had also travelled to Switzerland during a Wada conference, at which officials from the International Olympic Committee and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport were the victims of a cyber-attack, as well as to Brazil. It emerged last month that the Dutch government had expelled Russian spies in April after they were accused of planning to hack into the Spiez laboratory. In a joint statement on Thursday, the British prime minister, Theresa May, and her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, said: \"This attempt to access the secure systems of an international organisation working to rid the world of chemical weapons demonstrates the GRU's disregard for the global values and rules than keep us all safe. \"Our action today reinforces the clear message from the international community: we will uphold the rules-based international system, and defend international institutions from those that seek to do them harm.\" Last month, May pledged to step up action against Russian intelligence following the Salisbury attack. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The boot of a vehicle found outside the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague. Photograph: Netherlands defence ministry In a further blow to the GRU, Bellingcat, the investigative website, revealed that Russia appeared to have inadvertently identified the names and phone numbers of nearly 305 of its agents in its cyber-warfare department. The names appear on a list of individuals that have access to cars registered to the headquarters of the GRU's cyber division. Bellingcat said it may constitute \"one of the largest mass breaches\" of personal data in recent intelligence service history. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, dismissed the hacking accusations as \"big fantasies\". A senior British security official said: \"For the GRU to get caught in this way would be considered a pretty bad day.\" The Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, said Russian diplomats had been summoned to the foreign ministry. She told reporters the decision to publicise the failed attack was a \"far-reaching and unusual measure\" designed to \"send a very strong signal\" to the Kremlin that such behaviour would not be tolerated. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mobile phones, cameras and tablets found in the hire car. Photograph: Netherlands defence ministry The head of Dutch counter-intelligence said analysis of the men's laptops showed they had links to operations in Switzerland and Malaysia. A senior British security official, commenting on the possible link to the Skripal investigation, said: \"It is hard to know their full intention as their operation failed. But judging from past form elsewhere, discrediting the investigation could well have been their motivation.\" One of the alleged agents, Serebriakov, was listed on a Moscow amateur football league website as a defender. \"Our team is known as the 'security services' team. Almost everyone works for an intelligence agency,\" a teammate told the Moscow Times. \"I personally do not.\" Facebook Twitter Pinterest A picture believed to show one of the men at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Asked if the UK undertook the same surveillance methods as Moscow, they added: \"British intelligence cannot be put in the same moral and ethical bucket as the Russian security service. They do not have oversight.\" Play Video 0:51 Novichok attackers were Russian military intelligence, says May video On Thursday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The evidence is clearly against Russia on both the Salisbury attack and of course on the latest cyber-attacks so there has to be a confrontation, a diplomatic confrontation, with Russia on this.\" The revelations came hours after the British government directly accused Russian military intelligence of being behind a spate of \"reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attacks\" carried out on the orders of the Kremlin, including the hacking in 2016 of the US Democratic National Committee headquarters. A joint statement by Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the presidents of the European council and European commission respectively, along with the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said: \"We deplore such actions, which undermine international law and international institutions. \"The EU will continue to strengthen the resilience of its institutions and those of its member states, and international partners and organisations in the digital domain.\" <doc_sep> The Dutch government said Thursday that it blocked a cyberattack by Russian intelligence agents in April targeting the global chemical weapons watchdog agency. The head of the Netherland's military intelligence agency identified four Russians behind the alleged operation, which targeted the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW headquarters in The Hague. Dutch officials showed images of a rental vehicle they said was discovered at the time with computer equipment and transformers used in the alleged plot. He said the Russians were expelled from the Netherlands immediately after the plot was foiled on April 13. Later Thursday, the YOU.S. Department of Justice announced charges against seven Russian agents for cyber crimes linked to the Dutch investigation. The indictment accused the seven members of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, of hacking into the world anti-doping agency, the OPCW, and of cyberattacks aimed at a YOU.S. nuclear energy facility. An image released on October 4, 2018 by the Netherlands Defense Ministry shows a vehicle seized near the OPCW headquarters in The Hague, containing equipment allegedly used by Russian GRU military intelligence agents in a plot to hack the chemical weapons watchdog agency in April 2018. HANDOUT \"The conspiracy conducted persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting YOU.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement. The revelation of the plot in the Netherlands came just hours after Britain's Defense Minister Gavin Williamson, at a NATO summit with YOU.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and other allies, called Russia's cyberattacks of recent years the \"actions of a pariah state,\" and vowed that NATO would \"be exposing\" Moscow's nefarious acts. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia, not long after the announcement by the Netherlands, to halt its \"reckless\" behavior. \"Russia must stop its reckless pattern of behaviour, including the use of force against its neighbours, attempted interference in election processes, and widespread disinformation campaigns,\" he said in Brussels. \"Basically the Russians got caught with their equipment, people who were doing it, and they have got to pay the piper, they are going to have be held to account,\" Mattis said later Thursday at the NATO summit. \"How we respond to something like this is a political decision by the nations involved, and we will be standing by them. But it does not necessarily equate to some kind of tit for tat on cyber. We have a wide variety among our nations of responses available to us.\" Mattis lambasted Russia for the alleged attack on the OPCW, calling it, \"the latest of a world-wide pattern of reckless and irresponsible behavior from Moscow.\" NATO stands in solidarity with the Dutch UK governments in calling out Russia on its cyber attacks against OPCW others.

He noted that the plot was disrupted in April as the OPCW worked to confirm Britain's allegations that GRU agents attempted to murder Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in England, and to confirm an alleged chemical attack by Syria's Russian-backed military in Douma, Syria. \"The disruption of this attempted attack on the OPCW was down to the expertise and the professionalism of the Dutch security services in partnership with the United Kingdom,\" Wilson said. \"The OPCW is a respected international organization which is working to rid the world of chemical weapons. Hostile action against it demonstrates complete disregard for this vital mission.\" Inside Douma, the site of apparent Syrian chemical attack Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld-Schouten said the Russian intelligence officers had also targeted the Netherlands-based investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine. \"We have been aware of the interest of Russian intelligence services in this investigation and have taken appropriate measures.\" she said. \"We remain very alert about this.\" Bijleveld-Schouten said the Russian Ambassador to the Netherlands was summoned on Thursday to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be reprimanded for Moscow's \"unacceptable\" behavior. Ambassador Wilson said the plot in The Hague was not an isolated incident, accusing the same Russian military intelligence unit behind the thwarted plot of sending operatives around the world to carryout other, \"brazen, close-access cyber operations.\" How hackers could target a city's critical infrastructure on Election Day Britain and the Netherlands would be \"stepping up our combined activity against\" the GRU, Wilson said. \"We will shine a light on their activities. We will expose their methods, and we will share this with our allies.\" He said increased sanctions against Russia would be sought in retaliation for Moscow's \"malign activity.\" British Prime Minister Theresa May and her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte released a joint statement vowing to \"defend international institutions from those that seek do to them harm,\" and condemning the Russian military for its \"disregard for the global values and rules that keep us all safe.\" In London, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the Russian military's plot against the OPCW \"part of a sustained pattern of hostile cyberspace activity,\" and vowed that Moscow would face \"consequences.\"",

The global chemical weapons watchdog has been testing the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals in the UK. CBS News reports the four suspects, which included an IT expert, were caught \"in flagrante\" on April 13 and immediately removed from the country. The men were allegedly trying to hack into the OPCW via its WiFi network, reports the Guardian, supposedly after a spear-phishing attack launched from Russia failed.

The apparently well-informed thieves broke first into the catacombs from one of many secret or sealed entrances around Paris before drilling a hole through the cellar wall of the property near the Luxembourg gardens which houses the French Senate. After stealing the grands crus, they quietly vanished back underground, said police. <doc_sep> A gang of thieves managed to empty the Parisian cellar of a private residence of 300 of its finest wine bottles in the night between Monday and Tuesday 28 29 August The gang successfully pierced a hole in one of the walls of the private cellar, reports France Bleu. The flat was located in a fashionable Paris neighbourhood, near the Jardin du Luxembourg and the French Senate. Their loot amounts to 250,000 231,000 in fine wine and the thieves still remain at large. To complete their heist, they used a secret pathway in the Paris Catacombs. A police source analysing the audacious theft speculated: \"We believe they must have made visits before; the suspects did not drill that particular wall by accident.\" The 3rd District of the Parisian Criminal investigation department is in charge of the case and have so far refused to comment on the heist. The real-life artful dodgers managed to navigate the intricate maze that make up the Paris Catacombs. The one mile-long pathway tourists can visit is but one tiny fraction of the labyrinth. About 150 miles of dark corridors, dead ends and possible pits await thrill seekers who dare to explore the former communal cemetery. The Catacombs were once mines but at the end of the 18th century, they were converted into ossuaries to curb the overflow of bodies in the city's cemeteries. That is why in addition to their confusing structure and lack of light, the Catacombs are home to between six and seven millions of human remains. Skulls and rib cages lay along its walls. Apart from the path that is actually accessible to the public, the rest of the Catacombs are restricted. Whoever braves the interdiction risks a fine of 135 125 There are also legends about people dying in the Catacombs after explorations went wrong and of cults holding black masses in the ossuary. However sinister that may sound, many Parisians known as 'Cataphiles' like to brave the maze and enter the Catacombs at night. Some have organised parties or even film screenings. A special branch of the police force, called the 'Cataflics' or Catacops,' deal with the intruders. In June 2017, two teenagers were found safe after spending three days trapped in the Catacombs. The Quarries General Inspector, Julien Alaterre noted that the people who visit the Catacombs are \"usually well equipped regulars\". <doc_sep> Thieves who stole more than 250,000 euros worth of fine wine from a Paris apartment cellar exploited the French capital's vast underground tunnel network, according to French media reports. Thieves knocked through a wall of the Paris catacombs to break into the luxury apartment's cellar and steal an estimated 250,000 euros-worth of vintage wines, French media has reported police as saying. There are an estimated six million people buried in the Paris catacombs, part of a vast underground tunnel network stretching for several miles underneath the French capital. French media said that the thieves stole around 300 bottles of fine wine from the cellar of an apartment in the plush sixth arrondissement of Paris, near to the Le Jardin du Luxembourg. No specific wines were named. Paris police said that they were investigating how the theft took place. Police speculated that such precision in the catacombs network would require significant research and planning by the culprits. Earlier this summer, two teenagers were lost in the Paris catacombs for three days. Only two kilometres of the network is open to the public. The gates are locked at night, yet groups are known to find ways into the tunnels to hold illicit parties. Parisians began burying their dead underground in the 18th Century in response to overflowing graveyards. Some of the estimated six million dead met their end at the guillotine during the French Revolution and subsequent Terror period at the end of 18th Century. More articles like this:",

    "document": "ST. FRANCOIS COUNTY A Missouri Ku Klux Klan leader might have been shot in his sleep because he had told his wife he wanted a divorce, St. Francois County Prosecutor Jarrod Mahurin said Monday after filing murder charges. \"It may have been a marital issue,\" he told a reporter. He said Frank Ancona, 51, was shot in the head between 2 and 3 a.m. on Thursday. Malissa Ann Ancona, 44, of Leadwood, Mo., and her son, Paul Edward Jinkerson Jr., 24, of Belgrade, Mo., were charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse. Jinkerson shot his sleeping stepfather in the bedroom of the victim's home in Leadwood, sheriff's Detective Matt Wampler wrote in an affidavit accompanying the charges. Ancona's body was taken in Jinkerson's vehicle to an area outside Belgrade, where it was dumped near the Big River, Wampler wrote. Ancona called himself an imperial wizard with the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. A website for that group features an image of Ancona in a white hood and robe standing in front of a burning cross. His wife is shown next to him in another photo. The Park Hills Daily Journal said Ancona was reported missing Friday, when his employer called Leadwood police to say that he failed to show up work Wednesday or Thursday. A neighbor said Ancona had a job delivering parts for a St. Louis auto supply company. Malissa Ancona told investigators that he had been sent on a trip deliver a part, but the employer denied that, the newspaper said. She told authorities she had last seen her husband Wednesday. When investigators searched the Ancona home Saturday, they found \"extensive blood evidence\" in the master bedroom, officials said. Malissa Ancona told police in a recorded interview that Jinkerson shot her husband, and she helped clean up the blood and tried to cover up the crime, Wampler wrote. Mahurin said that both Ancona and Jinkerson were involved in disposal of the body and the cleanup. Police also found a safe that had been broken open. Frank Ancona's guns were missing. Malissa Ancona told police her husband took them and was planning to file for divorce when he returned from his work trip. Frank Ancona's abandoned car, found before his body was, appeared to have been \"wiped down,\" the prosecutor said, based on a chemical smell. Nearby was a pile of what appeared to be burned clothing, he said. Mahurin was not aware of any significance to the site where the body was left, other than it was nearby. The prosecutor said Jinkerson did not live with the Anconas but stayed with them occasionally. He called Jinkerson's relationship with Frank Ancona \"so-so,\" saying that there had been issues in the past but not lately. Both defendants could be arraigned as early as Tuesday, he said. They were held in jail without bail. Jinkerson also faces unrelated charges of property damage and attempted stealing, and was jailed over the weekend on a warrant that was issued after he was accused of violating his probation in a 2016 drug possession case. Eric Barnhart, a lawyer who represents Jinkerson in other cases, reacted to the murder charge by saying, \"I do not believe it for a second that he did it.\" Barnhart said he did not know if he will represent Jinkerson on the murder charge. Barnhart also said he did not believe that Jinkerson was involved in any hate groups. The young man was attending a local college, the lawyer said. Jinkerson's Facebook page says he is studying computer science at Mineral Area College in Park Hills. Leadwood police referred a reporter's questions to the St. Francois County Sheriff's Office and the Missouri Highway Patrol, which were not available for comment. On Friday night, Malissa Ancona had said on Facebook that her husband was missing and asked that anyone with information call the police. In online comments the next morning, she thanked friends for their good wishes and wrote, \"My heart is breaking.\" James Russell, 58, who lives next door to the Ancona residence, said the couple had lived there for about five years. Russell said he frequently heard Malissa Ancona screaming at her husband. Russell said he did not hear any gunshots on the day in question. But he did hear the banging of metal on metal in the predawn hours. Russell said he presumes that Malissa Ancona was seeking access to her husband's safe. He described Frank Ancona as a good man who was working to change attitudes about the Klan. Russell said Ancona hosted a few small Klan gatherings at the house in recent years, including one in which Ancona and perhaps 10 others wore robes and burned a cross. \"Everybody is talking about the Klan thing, but they are living in the past,\" Russell said, \"Frank was trying to improve the Klan and make it a force for good.\" Ancona has been quoted in stories in the Post-Dispatch about KKK leafletting in Desloge. His group was also at the center of a legal fight over a gathering of members at Fort Davidson State Historic Site, a Civil War battlefield in Pilot Knob, Mo. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate organizations, said that Ancona's group was \"not very significant at all. This was one of the smallest groups out there.\" Potok said the members received a lot of attention because they frequently handed out leaflets. He said he would be surprised if there were 40 members spread out among chapters in Potosi, Hayden, Idaho and Pennsylvania. Ancona had been in a dispute with other Klan leaders, Potok said, who accused Ancona of being secretly Jewish and Malissa Ancona of being a Wiccan. Both were untrue, Potok believes, but the accusations are typical of the Klan world today, which consists of 29 different named organizations, \"each one claiming to be the one true Klan and denigrating the others.\" Tony Rothert, who as legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri had represented Ancona in his court fights, called him a \"complicated and conflicted man.\" Rothert estimated his followers numbering in the low double digits. \"I and the ACLU found his views abhorrent and would say so. He understood that and recognized how unrealistic his views were at some level,\" Rothert added. An old Twitter page for Malissa Ancona contains links to Ancona's group and describes her as a member. Lately on social media, however, she was focused on creating a no-kill shelter for pets. Russell, the neighbor, said Frank Ancona grew up in the Potosi area. The Ancona home is a small, white frame house in need of repairs. Chicken wire is stapled across the posts of the front porch. Russell said Malissa Ancona had many pet cats, several of which were seen wandering the property Monday. Two dogs were barking inside the home. An American flag was nailed to the front porch. Next door, on the other side from Russell's home, is a blue mobile home where the victim's father lives. Out back is a white she would bearing two faded flags the American flag and the Confederate battle flag. Family at Frank Ancona's daughter's home declined to comment to a reporter. Leadwood, a town of about 500 people, is near Park Hills, about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis. As its name implies, it used to be the home of a lead mine and is in the heart of Missouri's old Lead Belt. Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch and The Park Hills Daily Journal contributed to this report. Tim O'Neil reported from Leadwood. <doc_sep> Ku Klux Klan Leader in Missouri Was Fatally Shot in the Head, Coroner Says A Ku Klux Klan leader in Missouri whose body was found near a river over the weekend was fatally shot in the head, a coroner said Monday.

She seemed only slightly overwhelmed: clad in a pink robe, one technician assigned to her fingernails, another to her toenails and another adding extensions to her already long black hair. \"I asked my agent if she was joking. I did not think an Asian girl would get this job.\" Victoria's Secret plucked Wen, 21, out of a regular model casting call. \"Liu Wen is a beautiful woman. She has a strong and energetic presence on the runway. She looked absolutely stunning in our fashion show,\" said the show's executive producer, Monica Mitro. At 5-foot-10, Wen said she towered over her classmates in China. The newest addition to the Victoria's Secret family was born in Yongzhou in China's Hunan province in 1988, the daughter of an interior designer dad and a stay-at-home mom. She was in high school when, on a whim, she submitted photos for a modeling contest, hoping to win the top prize of a laptop computer. \"I was studying to be a teacher in China and my friend was entering a modeling contest,\" she said. \"The prize was a computer, and I needed a computer for school. So I entered the contest, too, and then I won.\" Her family and friends, including the one who originally had the idea to enter the contest, were shocked. \"My friends were all surprised,\" she said. \"They were all like, 'sure, you are pretty.' Soon Wen had moved from Yongzhou to the Chinese capital of Beijing, where she appeared on the covers of Chinese editions of FHM and Marie Claire, as well as in editorials for Chinese Vogue. In 2008 she landed on the cover of Chinese Elle alongside fellow rising star Emma Pei. Wen made her runway debut in Milan, Italy, in 2008, followed quickly by Paris, France, and New York fashion weeks where she walked in such shows as Anna Sui, Dolce Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Chlo and Lanvin. Although her walk down the runway will be a first for Victoria's Secret, Wen is part of a growing trend for Asian models worldwide that began several years ago with Devon Aoki. The past few seasons of fashion shows have featured Asian models on almost every high-end runway. \"I talk to my mom in China every day when I am traveling. My family is always excited to hear about the top designers I am meeting and the clothes I get to wear,\" Wen said. She said was familiar with the Victoria's Secret show, though being on the inside was something new. \"Of course I had seen the show on television. I watched it every year,\" Wen said. \"But it was so different when I got here and got to meet the other girls. I got to meet Heidi Klum for the first time after I had known about her for so long. And she was so nice.\" Wen thinks she may try her hand at acting when she has gotten over the modeling bug, but she said she would be just as happy returning to China to be a teacher like she originally planned. \"In the classroom everyone respects the teacher. The teacher has all the control and has the ability to shape all of her students' lives,\" Wen said. \"But for now modeling is such great fun. I am still trying out new sexy faces.\" <doc_sep> Scroll down to se backstage video from the show. Victoria's Secret Angels strut runway in 3 million bras, 100 pounds of glitter Clary Getty Supermodel Selita Ebanks gets hair and makeup work backstage at Victoria's Secret show. When the Victoria's Secret Angels strut the runway Tuesday in 3 million bras, larger-than-life wings and barely there lingerie, what viewers will not see are the countless hours of work that goes into making the most beautiful women in the world look so ethereally sexy. The show, airing on CBS at 10, was shot at the Lexington Armory. \"It is all about creating the illusion of this amazing body on the runway,\" says Selita Ebanks, who walked her first Armory show five years ago. \"People do not realize that there are about 20 layers of makeup on my butt alone.\" In addition to body makeup, which Ebanks estimates takes well over an hour to apply, the Angels prep in hair and makeup for three to five hours before hitting the runway, with an average of five people hair stylists, makeup artists and manicurists, working on each of the 38 models. And if the hours of makeup, laboriously applied hair extensions and 100 pounds of body glitter worn collectively were not enough, the models are then squeezed into some of the most intricate garments imaginable. Ebanks' first look on the 140-foot-long runway is a gold lightning bolt strapped lengthwise across her middle. Think supersized Christmas tinsel weighing 30 pounds, and with dangerously sharp points. \"They added a 15-pound sandbag to my hip so the points would not scrape my thighs when I walked, and there was a metal rod in it,\" says Ebanks. \"When I first came out and cut that corner, my whole body tilted to the side and I thought, 'Oh my God, if I fall in this thing, forget my ego, my body is going to be jacked up.'\" But Ebanks made it work, repeating the mantra \"I am fierce\" over and over in her head. \"I called it my stark-kichu\" after the Japanese cartoon, says Ebanks. \"It was part of the Star Trooper segment of the show, and I felt like I was the cosmic star leading the girls to a sexy galaxy.\" Other out-of-this-world items featured Tuesday include Marisa Miller's 3 million bra dripping in diamonds and Candice Swanepoel's wings made out of oversized pocket watches. Ebanks, daughter of a New York City corrections officer and alum of Curtis High School on Staten Island, was glad to have the show back in her hometown. \"New Yorkers really appreciate a good production, and amazing people came out to support the show,\" says Ebanks. Supermodel Heidi Klum, who makes a surprise trip down the runway, and gave birth to her daughter Lou just weeks before the taping of the show, agrees. \"New Yorkers scream loud when you come out,\" says Klum, who also hosts the show. \"In other places, people tend to be a little more quiet, so it is fun to have the New York crowd.\"",

The 38 models spend three to five hours getting hair and makeup done-at the hands of five stylists each. One of the models using her share of the 100 pounds of body glitter on hand is Liu Wen, Victoria's Secret's first Asian model. The 21-year-old entered a modeling contest in her native China four years ago, trying to win a computer, and was plucked from a casting call by the Angels. \"Of course I had seen the show on television. I watched it every year,\" she tells CNN. \"But it was so different when I got here and got to meet the other girls.\"",

    "document": "Mitch Daniels, the conservative intelligentsia's choice for president in 2012, came to Washington on Wednesday to give a speech on education policy to a conservative think tank. But not 10 minutes into his address, he took an unexpected turn. \"Most of what I have talked about so far, and much of what I will, is strongly supported by the Obama administration,\" the Republican governor of Indiana told the standing-room-only crowd at the American Enterprise Institute. \"I salute the president, Secretary Arne Duncan. They are right about these things.\" Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive Off-message alert! One of the right-minded thinkers in the room rose to give Daniels a second chance to criticize Obama. The governor declined. \"I really do want to salute and commend and I have done it over and over the president, Secretary Duncan, for a lot of leadership in this area,\" he affirmed. \"There is a federal role\" in education, he argued. \"I believe in national standards.\" It may sound jarring these days to hear any conservative say anything nice about the Obama administration; Daniels also cheered the president's \"well-done, well-handled\" dispatching of Osama bin Laden. But the Indiana governor is following a well-written playbook. A dozen years ago, George W. Bush for whom Daniels later worked as White House budget director campaigned for the GOP presidential nomination as a different kind of Republican, a \"compassionate conservative\" motivated principally by concern for poor black kids and public schools. In the end, most of that turned out to be hooey; Bush was very much a conventional conservative. Daniels, likewise, is no bleeding heart but he is demonstrating himself to be a shrewd tactician. At a time when Republican voters are disenchanted with their presidential choices, and the existing candidates are marginalizing themselves by campaigning on abortion, homosexuality and birth certificates, not-yet-candidate Daniels looks like a grown-up. Daniels is not nearly as natural a politician as Bush he is about 5-foot-4, with a comb-over and he is much more of an intellectual his yawn-inducing talk explored \"administrative flexibility\" and \"state assessment tests\" Surely, some of his wonkish appeal would wear off once opponents began to portray him as the old drug-industry executive he is. But so far, the governor is doing well differentiating himself from the Republican field and in the process portraying himself to moderates as a non-threatening choice. Daniels, in the AEI speech, said teacher ratings would be based on the question \"Did the children grow?\" an echo of Bush's famous question \"Is our children learning?\" Like Bush, Daniels spoke of the need to help \"the kids from the most vulnerable homes.\" In a rebuke of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker R Daniels told the audience that \"collective bargaining has its place, always will.\" He spoke of \"social justice\" a verboten phrase among some conservatives and he softened his support for private-school vouchers by arguing that children must have two semesters in public school to be eligible. Daniels boasted that he increased education spending in Indiana as part of his plan for extending full-day kindergarten to all 5-year-olds. \"Indiana is number one in America in share of the state budget committed to education,\" he claimed. Democrats and teacher unions, of course, would beg to differ with Daniels's characterization of his policies. But the presentation to the conservative elite was more about packaging: He is the disarming alternative to the GOP's frightful field. He began with corny humor \"first thing you all need to know is you are here under false pretenses: I just came for a meal\" and segued into self-deprecation \"I do what lazy men do and show you a slide show\" He baffled the crowd with a one-liner about the recently deceased inventor of the teleprompter. He told a borscht-belt joke about \"Billy,\" who would not get up for school until his mother reminded him, \"You are the principal.\" He employed folksy phrases such as \"the bee that got in my bonnet,\" and he attempted an education metaphor using a high-jump style known as the \"Fosbury Flop.\" The aw-shucks routine also helped Daniels deflect a question from NPR's Mara Liasson about whether he could still enter the presidential race at this late stage. \"The man said, 'When I considers my opportunities I marvels at my self-restraint,' he quipped, before calling it a \"happy surprise\" that the race has yet to take shape. \"Unless you are a political professional or running a bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire, it is a darn good thing,\" Daniels said. So funny, so folksy, and so friendly to the disadvantaged: It is eerily similar to how another Republican governor presented himself to America a dozen springs ago. <doc_sep> Let us stop for a minute to consider Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana. Bet you did not see that one coming. Many of you may be unacquainted with Daniels. After all, a lot of Americans go for years on end without ever setting foot in Indiana even though it is a fine state, full of lovely people and some first-class universities, not to mention the RV Hall of Fame, the world's largest ball of paint and the Dan Quayle museum. But about Mitch Daniels. The political world has been abuzz with speculation that he will run for president. Centrist Republicans loved it when he began urging the party to keep its eye on the deficit-reduction prize and stop obsessing about social issues. \"Try to concentrate on making ends meet, which Washington obviously has failed to do for a long time, and have other policy debates in other places if you can,\" he advised. He then went home and announced that he would sign a bill to strip Planned Parenthood of Medicaid financing. \"He called a truce on social issues, and he was the first to fold,\" said Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"The suggestion I made about trying to set aside other issues was made in the national context,\" Daniels said over a lunch with journalists this week in New York. \"I was thinking more broadly than some people heard it.\" Actually, Daniels's moderate fans thought abortion was precisely the issue he was calling on Republicans to set aside. Right now, the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives can barely talk about anything else. State legislatures are flooded with bills to create \"Choose Life\" license plates, require women seeking abortions to look at sonograms of the fetus or make it harder for insurance companies to offer policies that cover abortions. At one point during an interminable debate on an anti-abortion bill in Florida, the Democrats had an embarrassing squabble between two members that ended when Representative Scott Randolph of Orlando threw his opponent's commemorative House pen in the trash. He is the same legislator who was privately admonished by the Republican House leadership for saying the word \"uterus.\" Florida is a wreck. This is not something I would normally recommend, but maybe they should all get together and work on naming an official state gun. The bill Daniels says he is going to sign in Indiana is a compilation of the anti-abortion movement's greatest hits. It will make it impossible for Medicaid recipients to make use of the 28 Planned Parenthood clinics in the state and bans abortions for pregnancies that have reached 20 weeks. Also, doctors would be required to tell women seeking abortions that \"medical evidence shows that a fetus can feel pain at or before 20 weeks,\" that human life begins when the egg is fertilized and that having an abortion could cause infertility. \"Pregnant women in the past might not have been provided with all the information,\" Daniels said. Possibly because all that information is questionable, theological or totally wrong. While Daniels is not a good example of a fiscal conservative who wants to move beyond the social wars, he is a real prototype of the peculiar strain in the political right that trusts people to make their own informed decisions without government intervention except when it comes to the most exquisitely personal choice a woman could ever face. In Washington, the new Republican majority's very first bill of the year, H.R. 1, eliminated both financing for Planned Parenthood and financing for the groundbreaking database of public safety complaints that the Consumer Product Safety Commission was about to put online. The database, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas warned, \"will drive jobs overseas.\" Legislatures in states that tend to be less than obsessive about consumers' right to know are competing to find more things to require that doctors tell or show their patients before they can get abortions. In South Dakota, women have to be told that abortion ends \"the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.\" A court tossed out another section that required doctors to say that the procedure leads to an increased risk of suicide. In his capacity as deficit hawk, Daniels waxes eloquent on his conviction that if Americans have to pay more of their medical bills, they will make smart choices about whether that nagging headache really requires the expense of a CAT scan. Doubting that the individual patient can judge whether more tests or medical procedures are required, Daniels said, \"demeans the dignity of people.\" However, women who are seeking an abortion have to be given not only the information they ask for, or the information the doctor thinks they need, but also faux facts that their local lawmakers want to force on them. And dignity be damned.",
    "reference_summary": "Two different views today on Indiana Gov.

Sure, Daniels famously called for a \"truce\" on social issues, but he is about to sign into law a bill that \"is a compilation of the anti-abortion movement's greatest hits.\" Among other things, it strips Planned Parenthood of Medicaid funds and requires doctors to give women information that is \"questionable, theological or totally wrong.\" Daniels \"is a real prototype of the peculiar strain in the political right that trusts people to make their own informed decisions without government intervention except when it comes to the most exquisitely personal choice a woman could ever face.\"",

    "document": "Steve Jobs' resignation as Apple Inc.'s CEO might seem like a step out of the spotlight at the world's largest company. But it is possible that little may change with the executive shuffle at Apple. As CEO, Jobs' bosses who he had to answer to were technically Apple's board of directors and shareholders. Jobs was also a member of the Apple board, but recently Apple had not listed anyone as Apple's official chairman. Instead, Apple listed two co-lead directors of the board; Andrea Jung, chairwoman and CEO of Avon Products Inc., and Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and CEO of Genentech Inc. Now Jobs is the chairman of the board. Photos: Steve Jobs and Apple's influence Jobs has not been running Apple's day to day operations since January, when he handed over those responsibilities to Tim Cook, the company's former chief operating officer who has been voted in as CEO by Apple's board. Despite being on a leave of absence for medical reasons, the details of which have remained private, Jobs has remained involved in some of Apple's biggest decisions this year. For example, it was Jobs who unveiled the iPad 2 in March, not Cook. As for who will announce and show off the iPhone 5 or iPad 3, Cook or Jobs, that remains to be seen. In being promoted from COO to CEO, Tim Cook has also been given a seat on Apple's board, just as Jobs had. The addition of Tim Cook to the board ups the number of directors from seven to eight. All other directors remain. Besides Jung and Levinson, the other directors are William V. Campbell, chairman of Intuit Inc.; Millard S. Drexler, chairman and CEO of J. Crew; former Vice President Al Gore; and Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO or Northrop Grumman Corp.

Credit: Apple Inc. <doc_sep> The only thing surprising about Steve Jobs's resignation-which Apple had telegraphed several times already-was the timing. Why now? Because of health concerns, maybe. Or maybe because now, right now, is the perfect time for the company to transition. When I say now, I am not talking about the dusky timing of the press release; the cardinal rule of bad news is that you bury it as late as you can. I mean now in the broader context of Apple's future. And if the company's going to not just survive but thrive without Jobs, he could not have left any sooner. And he definitely could not have waited. Apple has literally never been stronger. A month ago they reported record quarterly earnings in a period with no significant product releases, no back to school or holiday boost, all amid what turned out to be a grotesquely challenging three months for competitors like Dell and HP. They were, for a brief period, the most valuable company in the world. Incredible. And a month from now? They will be releasing their next iPhone on America's three major carriers. And very possibly something altogether new: an affordable iPhone, a handset for the masses. If that device does emerge, Apple will have transitioned from yuppie luxury to unprecedented populist value. So that is where Apple sits now, cratered between two mountainous achievements. If they would waited any longer, the iPhone 5 announcement would have been fully shrouded in memories of Jobs; with a month's distance, new CEO Tim Cook has a chance to stand on his own. He can bask in the reflected glory of the iPhone instead of languishing in Jobs's shadow. The company will feel like it is in good hands. Because it is. What is easy to forget is that companies have long, long product cycles. The iPhone 5's been done for months; ditto, likely, iPad 3. And iPhone 6 plans are well underway. They will all have a touch of Jobs in them. Even products with a longer horizon, future generations of MacBooks with sick-skinny bodies and flash storage and no optical disc, AppleTVs teeming with apps, will have Jobs's imprimatur. Especially since, uh, guys? He is staying on as Chairman of the Board. He is involved. So yes, there is a chance that Steve Jobs is resigning now because his medical situation has become so severe that he has no other choice. But we certainly hope not. And sincerely do not think so. Because this feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now. You can keep up with Brian Barrett, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google <doc_sep> ANALYSIS He may still be chairman of the board, but in the eyes of the world Steve Jobs has ceased to be the heart of Apple. The succession plan, one of the most closely guarded secrets this side of D-Day, is running. As it has been running for at least two years; the date of Jobs's departure may not have been known, but that it was approaching most certainly was. These past couple of years have been the strongest test yet of Jobs's famous reality distortion field, his ability to convince everyone he works with that what he says is either true or can must be made so. But some realities are not to be denied. Apple without Jobs is now one of them. Like any empire without its Caesar, what the next Apple will be, what it does and how it does it, depends on which of the factions within gains control. Many Apples For there are many Apples. One is that of new chief executive Tim Cook, who is as much responsible for Apple's success as Jobs was. He turned the business of actually making the goods into an imperial machine, controlling suppliers and manufacturers with unmatched ruthlessness. Making close to 100-percent margins on consumer electronics in an austere, hyper-competitive market is as miraculous as anything ever demonstrated in a keynote. Then there is the Apple normal people know and write about, a company capable of producing an endless stream of new products with pitch-perfect cadence. It is a marketing powerhouse for how else do you account for Apple's coronation as king of all things technology, when all it makes is a mobile phone now on its fourth incarnation, a mutant mobile phone too big to put in a pocket, and a few laptops? Put that way a valid analysis that seems heretical Apple's success is even more miraculous, more reality defying, than if it had been more like Sony with its huge range of products. And there is the innovatory Apple, which lives well beneath the radar. With the exception of the ghostly presence of Jonathan I Have, this is an invisible and unknown force. The products and services appear, companies are swallowed up, and the star players leave. The big decisions are no longer what chip to use, what new hardware features are too cool not to have, but what deals can be done with media companies, what marketing advantage can be gained by rounding up which supplier. Success through control The signs are strong that Tim Cook's Viking armies will prevail, and without a struggle. It is where the money comes from, and where any attack is to be resisted by any means necessary. Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had, but nearly irresistible for one that is learned that success comes through control. If you cannot out-think the competition, then it can be controlled through lawsuits and if you lose a few, it does not matter. The damage has been done. And Apple of late has been run by Cook. Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had. Looking beyond the iPhone and the iPad, both of which can only be refreshed so far, there is only uncertainty. Apple in the cloud is Apple unproven. Apple as innovator without Jobs is Apple unknown. Apple in a market where everyone else can do what it does, but can do it cheaper, is unApple. Apple will play to what strengths it has, and that looks like a marketing-led, litigiously-active, cash-rich giant determined to protect what it has over building out what comes next. For with Jobs, there was always a 'next', even if we did not know what it was going to be. As one part of the company's history was maturing, Steve Jobs would always be there on stage, unveiling just one more thing: the Mac, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. That will not happen again. Apple's future depends on the new next, and the longer we have to wait to see what happens, the less likely it will happen at all. <doc_sep> Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

In his role as CEO, Jobs had to answer to two groups: shareholders, and the board of directors. Now he is at the helm of that board. It was the perfect time to go, writes Brian Barrett for Gizmodo, noting that the coming release of the iPhone 5 and more affordable iPhone 4 should buoy the company and give CEO Tim Cook a chance to step into the spotlight. \"If they would waited any longer, the iPhone 5 announcement would have been fully shrouded in memories of Jobs. This feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now.\" Apple has lost its core, writes Rupert Goodwins for ZDNet, and only time will tell how this plays out. The iPhone and iPad can only be updated so many times, and with Jobs \"there was always a 'next.'\" But \"Apple as innovator without Jobs is Apple unknown.\" Its future \"depends on the new next, and the longer we have to wait to see what happens, the less likely it will happen at all.\"",

    "document": "LOS ANGELES CN The California Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a ruling that ordered improved conditions for elephants at Los Angeles Zoo, a setback for animal advocates who say the intelligent animals are being mistreated. In August 2007, Los Angeles resident Aaron Leider sued L.A. Zoo Director John Lewis and the City of Los Angeles, challenging the expansion of the zoo's elephant exhibit. Leider claimed the zoo subjected elephants to \"cruel, abusive and illegal treatment\" through use of chains, drugs, bullhooks and electric shocks. In 2012, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge John Segal stopped short of ruling that the zoo's treatment was inhumane but said officials need to take better care of the elephants. He ordered the city to stop using bullhooks or electric shocks and to exercise the elephants regularly. A divided appeals court affirmed. City leaders have recently highlighted conditions at the zoo, with Councilman Paul Koretz calling for the zoo to move an Asian elephant named Billy to a sanctuary. Zoo officials objected, saying that keepers are looking after the elephants. In his motion, Koretz relied on Segal's findings in the bench trial. Leider's complaint said the keeper had shocked Billy and that the animal was bobbing his head an indication, according to advocates, that he is stressed and isolated. But the California Supreme Court on Thursday reversed the appeals court. Justice Carol Corrigan rejected the theory in Leider's taxpayer action: that the alleged criminal mistreatment of the animals was an unlawful use of public money. Under California law, a taxpayer action cannot be used to enforce violations of criminal law, so an injunction against the city cannot stand, according to the unanimous court. \"Here, the trial court found that the city and its zoo director had violated penal code statutes proscribing animal abuse, but it provided them neither the right to a jury trial nor the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Corrigan wrote. \"Moreover, Leider was permitted to exercise the discretion reserved for the district attorney with regard to enforcement of the criminal law. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal's judgment cannot stand.\" Leider's attorney David Casselman called the ruling \"extremely disappointing,\" and said evidence showed that elephants had died prematurely because of conditions at the zoo. \"Having gone all the way through trial and proving the need for injunctive relief under recognized statutory authority, it was very surprising that the Supreme Court would change the rules and effectively ignore the statutory scheme that has existed for decades,\" Casselman said in an interview. He said he hoped for a retrial before a jury. \"If it is possible, I intend to pursue this through the Legislature, or anywhere else, to protect these elephants who are suffering dying prematurely,\" he said. The zoo praised the high court's decision. \"Today's California Supreme Court decision validates what Angelenos already know: the LA Zoo and its staff provides the highest level of care for our elephants and all our animals,\" LA Zoo spokeswoman April Spurlock wrote in an email. \"Our elephants live in one of the best and largest elephant habitats in North America at a state-of-the-art facility that has tremendous resources, a dedicated staff, and provides top-quality health care.\" The city did not respond to a request for comment. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.

    "reference_summary": "For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit which uses civil law rules cannot be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he will attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

    "document": "Image copyright IUCN Image caption A combination of factors has helped drive down giraffe populations in many parts of Africa A dramatic drop in giraffe populations over the past 30 years has seen the world's tallest land mammal classified as vulnerable to extinction. Numbers have gone from around 155,000 in 1985 to 97,000 in 2015 according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN The iconic animal has declined because of habitat loss, poaching and civil unrest in many parts of Africa. Some populations are growing, mainly in southern parts of the continent. Until now, the conservation status of giraffes was considered of \"least concern\" by the IUCN. The giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people Dr Julian Fennessy, IUCN However in their latest global Red List of threatened species, the ungainly animal is now said to be \"vulnerable\", meaning that over three generations, the population has declined by more that 30 According to Dr Julian Fennessy, who co-chairs the IUCN giraffe specialist group, the creatures are undergoing a \"silent extinction\". \"If you go on a safari, giraffes are everywhere,\" he told BBC News. \"While there have been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar but, unfortunately, their numbers have been plummeting, and this is something that we were a little shocked about, that they have declined by so much in so little time.\" The rapid growth of human populations has seen the expansion of farming and other forms of development that has resulted in the fragmentation of the giraffe's range in many parts of Africa. But civil unrest in parts of the continent has also taken its toll. \"In these war torn areas, in northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia in the border area with South Sudan, essentially the giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people,\" said Dr Fennessy. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Habitat loss and war are among the ways humans have caused the big drop in giraffe numbers, says Mike Jordan of Chester Zoo A study in recent months suggested that the giraffe was actually four different species but for this update of the Redlist, the IUCN have stuck with the traditional definition of one species with nine subspecies. Of these, five have had falling populations, one has remained stable while three have grown. Different outcomes seem to be highly dependent on location. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The curious nature of the giraffe makes them an easier target for hunters and armed gangs \"The species in southern Africa, those numbers are increasing by two to three times over the last three decades,\" said Dr Fennessy. \"But when you come up through East Africa, those numbers have plummeted some by up to 95 of the population in the case of the Nubian giraffe, in the last three decades alone.\" Solutions exist While researchers believe that some local populations may not survive, there is optimism that that the long term future of these tall creatures can be secured. The success in keeping giraffe numbers high in Southern Africa has much to do with the management of game parks for tourists say experts, who believe that the extra attention that the IUCN listing will now attract will benefit the species. \"South Africa is a good example of how you can manage wildlife, there is a lot of moving of animals between different conservation areas, it is a very different scenario than in most of the rest of Africa.\" said Chris Ransom from the Zoological Society of London. \"I think giraffes can survive, with the right conservation efforts, and we can ensure that the animals do live in the wild. There are a lot of cases of success in conservation. The giraffes could be one.\" The latest edition of the IUCN Red List now contains over 85,000 species in total with more than 24,000 threatened with extinction. Over 700 newly recognised bird species have been added, with 11 of them on the edge of survival. One bird, the Antioquia wren has been listed as \"endangered\" as more than half of its habitat in Colombia could be wiped out by proposed dam. Invasive species on islands are also seen as a threat for many birds including the Pagan reed-warbler and the Laysan honeycreeper.

The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world's biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a powerful tool to inform and catalyze action for biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural resources we need to survive. It provides information about range, population size, habitat and ecology, use and or trade, threats, and conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation decisions. <doc_sep> Cancun, Mexico, 8 December 2016 IUCN Over 700 newly recognised bird species have been assessed for the latest update of The IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM, and 11 of them are threatened with extinction. The update also reveals a devastating decline for the giraffe, driven by habitat loss, civil unrest and illegal hunting. The global giraffe population has plummeted by up to 40 over the last 30 years, and the species has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Today's IUCN Red List update also includes the first assessments of wild oats, barley, mango and other crop wild relative plants. These species are increasingly critical to food security, as their genetic diversity can help improve crop resistance to disease, drought and salinity. The update was released today at the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity CBD COP13 in Cancun, Mexico. The IUCN Red List now includes 85,604 species of which 24,307 are threatened with extinction. \"Many species are slipping away before we can even describe them,\" says IUCN Director General Inger Andersen. \"This IUCN Red List update shows that the scale of the global extinction crisis may be even greater than we thought. Governments gathered at the UN biodiversity summit in Cancun have the immense responsibility to step up their efforts to protect our planet's biodiversity not just for its own sake but for human imperatives such as food security and sustainable development.\" Birds: Newly recognised, already threatened This IUCN Red List update includes the reassessment of all bird species. Thanks to a comprehensive taxonomic review compiled by BirdLife International, working in collaboration with the Handbook of the Birds of the World, the overall number of bird species assessed has reached 11,121. A total of 742 newly recognised bird species have been assessed, 11 of which are threatened. For example, the recently described Antioquia wren Thryophilus sernai has been listed as Endangered as more than half of its habitat could be wiped out by a single planned dam construction. Habitat loss to agriculture and degradation by invasive plants have also pushed the striking Comoro blue vanga Cyanolanius comorensis into the Endangered category. Thirteen of the newly recognised bird species enter the IUCN Red List as Extinct. Several of these have been lost within the past 50 years such as the Pagan reed-warbler Acrocephalus yamashinae O'ahu akepa Loxops wolstenholmei and Laysan honeycreeper Himatione fraithii All of these species were endemic to islands, and were most likely wiped out by invasive species. \"Unfortunately, recognising more than 700 'new' species does not mean that the world's birds are faring better,\" says Dr Ian Burfield, BirdLife's Global Science Coordinator. \"As our knowledge deepens, so our concerns are confirmed: unsustainable agriculture, logging, invasive species and other threats such as the illegal trade highlighted here are still driving many species towards extinction.\" IUCN Red List assessments also reveal that some of the world's most popular birds may soon disappear in the wild if appropriate action is not taken. Iconic species, such as the African grey parrot Psittacus erithacus a prized pet with the ability to mimic human speech are facing extinction in the wild due to unsustainable trapping and habitat loss. Native to central Africa, the grey parrot has seen its conservation status deteriorate from Vulnerable to Endangered. A study led by BirdLife International discovered that in some parts of the continent numbers of grey parrots have declined by as much as 99 The situation is most pressing in Asia, with the rufous-fronted laughingthrush Garrulax rufifrons scarlet-breasted lorikeet Trichoglossus forsteni and Straw-headed bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus among a suite of species being uplisted to higher threat categories as a result of the impacts of illegal wildlife trade. There is now evidence that unsustainable levels of capture for the cagebird trade, largely centred on Java, are driving the deteriorating status of many species. However, there is good news for some of the rarest and most vulnerable birds on our planet those that exist only on small, isolated islands. The Azores bullfinch Pyrrhula murina St Helena plover Charadrius sanctaehelenae and Seychelles white-eye Zosterops modestus are among the island endemic species to move to lower categories in this IUCN Red List update, as their populations recover from the brink of extinction thanks to tireless conservation efforts. Giraffe The iconic giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis one of the world's most recognisable animals and the tallest land mammal, is now threatened with extinction. The species, which is widespread across southern and eastern Africa, with smaller isolated subpopulations in west and central Africa, has moved from Least Concern to Vulnerable due to a dramatic 36-40 decline from approximately 151,702-163,452 individuals in 1985 to 97,562 in 2015. The growing human population is having a negative impact on many giraffe subpopulations. Illegal hunting, habitat loss and changes through expanding agriculture and mining, increasing human-wildlife conflict, and civil unrest are all pushing the species towards extinction. Of the nine subspecies of giraffe, three have increasing populations, whilst five have decreasing populations and one is stable. A resolution adopted at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in September this year called for action to reverse the decline of the giraffe. Crop wild relatives With this update, the first assessments of 233 wild relatives of crop plants such as barley, oats and sunflowers have been added to the IUCN Red List. Habitat loss, primarily due to agricultural expansion, is the major threat to many of these species. The assessments were completed as part of a partnership between Toyota Motor Corporation and IUCN, whose aim is to broaden the IUCN Red List to include the extinction risk of many species that are key food sources for a significant portion of the global population. Crop wild relatives are a source of genetic material for new and existing crop species, allowing for increased disease and drought resistance, fertility, nutritional value and other desirable traits. Almost every species of plant that humans have domesticated and now cultivate has one or more crop wild relatives. However, these species have received little systematic conservation attention until now. Four mango species have been listed as Endangered, and the Kalimantan mango Mangifera casturi has been listed as Extinct in the Wild. These species are relatives of the common mango Mangifera indica and are threatened by habitat loss. Native to South Asia, mangoes are now cultivated in many tropical and sub-tropical countries and they are one of the most commercially important fruits in these regions. A relative of cultivated asparagus, hamatamabouki Asparagus kiusianus which is native to Japan, has been listed as Endangered due to habitat loss caused by urban expansion and agriculture. Loss of habitat is also the main threat to the Anomalus sunflower Helianthus anomalus which has been listed as Vulnerable and is a relative of the sunflower H. annuus Cicer bijugum, native to Iran and Turkey, is a wild relative of the chickpea C. arietinum it has been listed as Endangered due to habitat conversion to agriculture. \"Crop wild relative species are under increasing threat from urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and intensive farming, and probably climate change,\" says Mr. Kevin Butt, General Manager, Regional Environmental Sustainability Director, Toyota Motor North America. \"To conserve this vital gene pool for crop improvement we need to urgently improve our knowledge about these species. Toyota is pleased to provide support for the assessment of these and other species on The IUCN Red List.\" Freshwater species Lake Victoria All freshwater molluscs, crabs, dragonflies and freshwater fishes native to Lake Victoria in central Africa are included in this update. Key threats to Lake Victoria known as Darwin's dream pond due to its high biodiversity include invasive species such as the Nile perch Lates niloticus overharvesting, sedimentation due to logging and agriculture, as well as water pollution from pesticides and herbicides.

The new total of 6,649 passerines implies that avian diversity at the species level was previously underestimated by more than 10 BirdLife now applies a single, consistent taxonomic approach worldwide, across all species. As a result, the number of recognised species rises above 11,000 for the first time to 11,121. Thirteen out of the 742 newly recognised species are already extinct all were island endemics and likely driven extinct by invasive species on Hawai'i, Pacific islands, Indian Ocean islands, Galpagos and Bermuda First non-English language assessments published The first non-English language assessments have been published on the IUCN Red List. Assessments for 20 species from the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil have been included, with the text in Portuguese. They were provided by CNCFlora who also serve as the IUCN SSC Brazil Plant Red List Authority These species are mostly localised endemics from the Mata Atlntica forest which has been substantially reduced by urban and agricultural expansion. Supporting quotes \"Whilst giraffe are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people including conservationists are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction. With a decline of almost 40 in the last three decades alone, the world's tallest animal is under severe pressure in some of its core ranges across East, Central and West Africa. As one of the world's most iconic animals, it is timely that we stick our neck out for the giraffe before it is too late,\" says Julian Fennessy, co-chair of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group. \"Despite continuing conservation efforts to protect the immense diversity of life in Lake Victoria from growing threats, we are still seeing alarming declines in species populations, as this Red List update shows. Systematic monitoring at the species level has been lacking so far, and we urgently need to invest in monitoring and more conservation action to protect these species, many of which are critical to the livelihoods of people living around the lake,\" says Dr William Darwall, Head of IUCN Freshwater Biodiversity Unit. Quotes from Red List partners \"The addition of new species to the IUCN Red List, some of them already threatened with extinction, emphasises the urgency to produce conservation assessments to better prioritise species in need of conservation action as soon as the species are discovered. The first assessments of many crop wild relatives also highlight the need for conservation action, both in situ and ex situ, to ensure our future food security.\" Botanical Gardens Conservation International BCGI \"It is certainly a concern that iconic species like the loquacious African grey parrot Endangered and the giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis Vulnerable are now listed as Threatened,\" states Dr. Thomas Lacher, Jr. from Texas A M University. \"In addition, four wild relatives of the common mango are now Endangered and an additional wild relative Extinct in the Wild. The loss of genetic diversity in the wild relatives of many of our domestic food crops only erodes future options for new crop resources under changing climates.\" The Zoological Society of London ZSL supports the management and monitoring of key sites for giraffe in the wild, including the Tsavo Conservation Area in Kenya via the SMART patrol management system, and has also supported the development of Kenya's first National Giraffe Conservation Strategy. Both ZSL London Zoo and ZSL Whipsnade Zoo are home to giraffes, and ZSL co-hosts the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group with the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. Co-chair of the Specialist Group, ZSL's Dr Nolle Kmpel warns, \"Most people have no idea that both species of giraffid, the giraffe and its lesser-known Congolese rainforest cousin the okapi, are suffering dramatic declines and are now both threatened with extinction. IUCN recently passed a key resolution calling for greater awareness and efforts to secure the future of these hugely charismatic, iconic and gentle species in the wild, including safeguarding key protected areas.\" \"Several newly recognized bird species have made it to the Red List as Extinct, suggesting that extinction rates for other taxa are likely higher than we think. Yet there are bright spots many rare and vulnerable birds have shown signs of recovery, providing good evidence that it is not too late to recover extant populations that are balancing on the brink of extinction,\" says Leah Gerber, Director, Center for Biodiversity Outcomes, Arizona State University. \"It is critical as a global community that we continue to identify, prioritize, and conserve biodiversity, and the diversity of crop wild relatives, as we experience more and more climate driven impacts. These species can help crops and communities become more resilient and adapt to new conditions created by climate change,\" says Daniela Raik, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, Moore Center for Science. <doc_sep> WASHINGTON AP The giraffe, the tallest land animal, is now at risk of extinction, biologists say. Because the giraffe population has shrunk nearly 40 percent in just 30 years, scientists put it on the official watch list of threatened and endangered species worldwide, calling it \"vulnerable.\" That is two steps up the danger ladder from its previous designation of being a species of least concern. In 1985, there were between 151,000 and 163,000 giraffes but in 2015 the number was down to 97,562, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN At a biodiversity meeting Wednesday in Mexico, the IUCN increased the threat level for 35 species and lowered the threat level for seven species on its \"Red List\" of threatened species, considered by scientists the official list of what animals and plants are in danger of disappearing. The giraffe is the only mammal whose status changed on the list this year. Scientists blame habitat loss. While everyone worries about elephants, Earth has four times as many pachyderms as giraffes, said Julian Fennessy and Noelle Kumpel, co-chairs of the specialty group of biologists that put the giraffe on the IUCN Red List. They both called what is happening to giraffes a \"silent extinction.\" \"Everyone assumes giraffes are everywhere,\" said Fennessy, co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. But they are not, Fennessy said. Until recently, biologists had not done a good job assessing giraffes' numbers and where they can be found, and they have been lumped into one broad species instead of nine separate subspecies. \"There is a strong tendency to think that familiar species such as giraffes, chimps, etc. must be OK because they are familiar and we see them in zoos,\" said Duke University conservation biologist Stuart Pimm, who was not part of the work and has criticized the IUCN for not putting enough species on the threat list. \"This is dangerous.\" Fennessy blamed shrinking living space as the main culprit in the declining giraffe population, worsened by poaching and disease. People are moving into giraffe areas especially in central and eastern Africa. Giraffe numbers are plunging most in central and eastern Africa and are being offset by increases in southern Africa, he said. This has fragmented giraffe populations, making them shrink in size with wild giraffes gone from seven countries Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal, said Kumpel of the Zoological Society of London. The IUCN says 860 plant and animal species are extinct, and another 68 are extinct in the wild. Nearly 13,000 are endangered or critically endangered. The next level is vulnerable, where giraffes were placed, followed by near threatened and least concerned. The status of two snake species worsened. The ornate ground snake, which lives on the tiny island of Saint Lucia, deteriorated from endangered to critically endangered. The Lacepede's ground snake of Martinique, which was already critically endangered, is now considered possibly extinct, pending confirmation, as is the trondo mainty, a river fish in Madagascar. But there is also good news for some species. The Victoria stonebasher, a freshwater fish in Africa, went from being considered endangered to least concerned with a stable population. And an African plant, the acmadenia candida, which was declared extinct, has been rediscovered and is now considered endangered. Another freshwater fish, ptychochromoides itasy, which had not been seen since the 1960s, has been rediscovered in small numbers in Africa's Sakay River and is now considered critically endangered. _ Online: International Union for the Conservation of Nature: https: www.iucn.org _ Follow Seth Borenstein at http: twitter.com borenbears and his work can be found at http: bigstory.ap.org content seth-borenstein",

But new numbers from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature show a significant decline in their population over the past three decades and have conservationists worried that the elegant creature is falling victim to what one IUCN expert calls a \"silent extinction,\" the BBC reports. In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015-a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40 that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there has been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There is a strong tendency to think that familiar species such as giraffes, chimps, etc. must be OK because we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable. A resolution passed in September at the IUCN's World Conservation Congress hopes to reverse the falling numbers of \"Africa's iconic megafauna.\" Three rare giraffes were killed for their tails.",

In a lawsuit filed Monday in YOU.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Monster says Herrera's effort would \"impose undue burdens on interstate commerce\" and violate constitutionally protected \"commercial speech\" and other rights. The lawsuit also contends that Herrera appears to be motivated by publicity rather than science.\" Herrera has been investigating the Corona Riverside County -based maker of Monster Energy drinks since October under the state's unfair competition law, targeting its marketing claims that the amount of caffeine in its products is \"completely safe\" and that consumers \"can never get too much of a good thing!\" In March, Herrera joined a group of 18 doctors from medical centers across the country in calling for the YOU.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate caffeine levels in energy drinks, saying the beverages pose health risks, particularly for youths. Under current FDA standards, caffeine in sodas can register no higher than about 71 milligrams per 12-oz. serving. Energy drinks often have between 100 and 300 milligrams of caffeine per 8-oz. serving and are often sold in much larger quantities per can, according to the doctors' letter. \"The best available scientific evidence demonstrates a robust correlation between the caffeine levels in energy drinks and adverse health and safety consequences, particularly among children, adolescents, and young adults,\" according to the doctors' letter, which included signatories from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, UC Berkeley's School of Public Health and UCSF's pediatric and cardiology divisions Monster markets to children as young as 6 years old, according to Herrera's office, which produced screen shots from the beverage company's \"Monster Army\" website listing an 11-year-old as a \"Monster Army Major\" and a 6-year-old as a \"Reserve.\" The company, in its lawsuit, maintains that its product has less than half the caffeine of a Starbucks coffee. \"Today, any child can walk into a Starbucks and buy an unlimited number of 'Grande' 16-oz. brewed coffee drinks-each one with more than twice the caffeine 330mg as one of Monsters' 16-oz. energy drinks-with no restrictions or limitations,\" the company's attorneys wrote. That is not the same thing, according to Herrera's office. \"Starbucks is not marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people,\" Herrera spokesman Matt Dorsey said. \"The scientific consensus is these products are not safe for children.\" Herrera, in a statement, vowed to aggressively fight what he termed \"an apparently preemptive lawsuit.\" \"Monster Energy is claiming an unfettered right to continue marketing its products to children and youth, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that its products pose serious risks to young people's health and safety,\" said Herrera. \"I intend to litigate this case aggressively to reform their irresponsible marketing and business practices, which I believe clearly violate California's consumer protection laws.\" <doc_sep> Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

One thing in particular that irritates Herrera is that the company has a Monster Army website for kids that shows an 11-year-old \"Monster Army Major\" and a 6-year-old \"Reserve,\" reports the San Francisco Chronicle. So, yes, the energy drinks have less caffeine than a cup at Starbucks, but the coffee chain \"is not marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people,\" says a Herrera spokesperson.

Josh Stephen WFAA MARFA, Texas United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's heart stopped beating during his sleep, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara told WFAA on Sunday. Guevara officially pronounced him dead at 1:52 p.m. on Saturday. She will be the local official who signs his death certificate. Hours earlier, the county judge told WFAA that myocardial infarction or a heart attack would likely be the because of death listed. Guevara later said she would confer with the Justice's personal physician on what specifically to show as the because of death. Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara was in Alpine when she learned of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at the Cibolo Creek Ranch in West Texas. Scalia's remains were later moved to El Paso. WFAA Scalia's remains were discreetly driven by van overnight to an El Paso funeral home with an escort from a procession of Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers and YOU.S. Marshals Service vehicles. After arriving at 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, the Sunset Funeral Home embalmed Scalia's remains, according to Chris Lujuan, a funeral home manager. Embalming is required by Texas law before a body can be transported out of state. Sunset Funeral Home said it is collecting vital information for Scalia's death certificate. Lujuan said Scalia's remains would likely begin the journey back to northern Virginia sometime on Monday, though it is uncertain exactly how the body would be transported. Judge Guevara said she was shopping in the neighboring town of Alpine on Saturday afternoon when Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez called her on her mobile phone after lunch. \"He says, 'Judge, I am at Cibolo Creek Ranch, and a Supreme Court Justice has just passed away, and I need someone here immediately. Both justices of the peace are out of town at this time,'\" Guevara recounted to WFAA. JusticeScalia was found in his room the \"Presidente\" suite at CiboloRanch about 11a Saturday.

Copyright 2016 WFAA <doc_sep> Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who announced in late-September that he would not be seeking reelection in 2018, never had a particularly strong relationship with Donald Trump. In May, he described the Trump administration as being in the midst of a \"downward spiral.\" Three months later he criticized Trump's handling of Charlottesville, saying the president \"has not demonstrated he understands the character of this nation.\" But it was not until Corker announced that he was not seeking reelection, that the relationship between Trump and Corker was fully severed. On Sunday, after Corker had repeatedly criticized Trump's handling of foreign policy, the president took to Twitter: Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, that is about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts Reform, we need people that can get the job done! Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump October 8, 2017 Corker fired back: It is a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. Senator Bob Corker SenBobCorker October 8, 2017 Later that day, Corker told The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Mark Landler that the president's \"reality show\" approach to governance was leading the country \"into World War III. \"He concerns me. He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\" This is a significant development, given Corker's influence as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. But it is easy to overstate its significance. After all, we have been here before-Jeff Flake wrote an entire book criticizing Trump that just happened to be published the same week that Flake voted for a health care bill being pushed by the president that would have had disastrous consequences for millions of Americans. It does take some courage to criticize the president but, like Flake, Corker has not yet done anything to meaningfully constrain Trump, either on foreign policy or anywhere else. Instead, his comments are best understood as an attempt to influence the president's behavior-social media and press coverage, of course, are the two best ways to reach Trump and his inner circle. In his interview with the Times, Corker made it clear that he thinks that most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate are just as concerned about Trump's unstable behavior as he is. \"Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we are dealing with here,\" Corker said. \"If you write that, I am sure there will be some that will come to you and say, 'No, no, no. I do not believe that.' But of course they understand the volatility that we are dealing with, and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.\" But that only makes Corker's comments more inadequate. If he really is speaking for \"the vast majority\" of Senate Republicans than the fact that they have done nothing meaningful about Trump's abuses of power and dangerous foreign policy all the more galling. Corker recognizes that we are in the middle of a crisis. But crises require action-and Corker has not done anything meaningful, at least not yet. <doc_sep> The body of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has arrived at a Texas funeral home a day after he died while on a hunting trip.

But the video appeared on YouTube and other sites more than a week ago, when what is now called Hurricane Irma was still far out at sea, as rains from Hurricane Harvey pummeled the gulf region.

One minute-long video posted on YouTube shows the man taking off his clothes and diving into the Dangerous Lagoon, a 2.9-million-litre tank that offers an underwater gallery to dozens of marine animals. The naked man can be seen doing the breaststroke on the surface of the water while sand tiger sharks swim within centimetres of his feet. Green sawfish, green sea turtles, green moray eels and other species of tropical fish are also housed in the tank, according to the aquarium's website. Security at the popular tourist attraction asked the man to leave shortly before 10:30 p.m. ET but he refused, said Jenifferjit Sidhu, a spokesperson for Toronto Police Service.

As Acland and her boyfriend approached it, she said, they saw a man in the water. \"The guy seemed totally relaxed and there were sharks like everywhere,\" she told CBC Toronto. \"He appeared to be totally nude and like laughing.\" Acland described the display as unexpected and horrifying. \"I do not know what would possess someone to do that. It is totally insane to me,\" she explained. \"I was scared I was going to witness the death of this guy.\" A video by a visitor who captured the man's aquatic adventure has received more than 5,000 views on YouTube.

Police have not been able to locate the man, but they are looking to speak to him. He could be facing charges of trespassing, mischief and indecent exposure, said Sidhu.

Brown, who is black, was unarmed when he was shot August 9 by Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A. Associated Press Thousands of mourners filled the massive Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis for the funeral, which began with upbeat music punctuated by clapping. Some mourners danced in place, and ushers passed out water and tissues. Eric Davis, one of Brown's cousins, urged the crowd to go to the polls and push for change, saying the community has had \"enough of the senseless killings.\" Brown's uncle, Bernard Ewing, described Brown as a \"big guy, but a kind, gentle soul.\" He recalled his nephew once telling the family that someday his name would be known by the wider world. \"He did not know he was offering up a divine prophecy at that time,\" Ewing said. Another uncle, pastor Charles Ewing, said in his eulogy that Brown's \"blood is crying from the ground, crying for vengeance, crying for justice.\" Among the mourners was Will Acklin, a black man from Little Rock, Arkansas. \"It is important in that as a child I was pushed by police, mistreated by police, cursed by police, and I was a good kid,\" said Acklin, who is 63. \"I was an honor student. When I heard this, I felt compelled to come here and show my respects.\" Angela Pierre, a machine operator who once lived in Ferguson, where the shooting happened and fueled nearly two weeks of street protests, said she hopes the funeral helps turn a page and eases tensions. Most important, though, she hopes it provides healing for Brown's family. \"I really wanted to just be here today to pray for the family and pray for peace,\" said Pierre, 48, who is black. \"When all of this dies down, there still a mother, father and a family who is lost someone. Sometimes a lot of the unrest takes away from that.\" The church's sanctuary, which seats about 2,500, filled quickly. Overflow rooms holding another 2,000 were full, too. With the church at capacity, many people could not get in and instead waited outside, crowded into shady areas on a day when the temperature was expected to come close to 100 degrees. Ambulance crews were on hand in case of any heat-related illnesses. Poster-size photos of Brown, wearing headphones, were on each side of the closed casket, which had a St. Louis Cardinals ball cap atop it. Large projection screens showed a photo of Brown clutching his high school diploma while wearing his cap and gown. He had been scheduled to start training at a technical school two days after his death. He wanted to become a heating and air-conditioning technician. Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., has asked protesters to take a break Monday and observe a \"day of silence\" so the family can grieve. \"Tomorrow all I want is peace,\" he told hundreds of people Sunday in St. Louis' largest city park during brief remarks at a festival that promotes peace over violence. \"That is all I ask.\" Early Monday morning, Brown's request appeared to be honored. At the Ferguson Police Department, where a small but steady group of protesters have stood vigil for two weeks, a handmade sign announced a \"break for funeral.\" The West Florissant Avenue commercial corridor was also devoid of protesters, whose ranks have typically swelled as days turned to nights. Brown was unarmed when he was shot August 9 by officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A grand jury is considering evidence in the case, and a federal investigation is also underway. Police have said a scuffle broke out after Wilson told Brown and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. Police said Wilson was pushed into his squad car and physically assaulted. Some witnesses have reported seeing Brown's arms in the air an act of surrender. An autopsy found Brown was shot at least six times. Family members denounced a video released by police, who say it shows Brown snatching some cigars in a convenience store just before he was killed. In the video, the person said to be Brown is seen grabbing a clerk by the shirt and forcefully pushing him into a display rack. Family and friends say Brown was an aspiring rapper with a gentle, joking manner who dubbed himself \"Big Mike.\" He was good at fixing things, liked computer games, the rapper Lil Wayne, Drake, the movie \"Grown Ups 2,\" and the TV show \"Family Guy.\" \"We do not want anything tomorrow to happen that might defile the name of Michael Brown,\" Sharpton said as he stood next to Brown's father on Sunday. \"This is not about our rage tomorrow. It is about the legacy and memory of his son.\" President Barack Obama sent three White House aides. Others in attendance included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, moviemaker Spike Lee and entertainer Sean Combs, as well as many local and regional civil rights leaders. The Rev. Al Sharpton was also expected to speak. Monday also marked the first day back at school for students in the Ferguson-Florissant School District. Classes were scheduled to begin August 14 but postponed due to safety concerns. School personnel have received training in how to deal with students who may be experiencing stress related to the shooting and its aftermath. \"I am excited,\" said Marcus Baker, a junior at McCluer South-Berkeley High School. \"We are ready to move forward. But we are still going to remember him.\" _ Associated Press Writer Alan Scher Zagier in Ferguson contributed to this report. <doc_sep> St. Louis CNN The funeral of slain Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown was a celebration of his life, a search for meaning in his death and a battle cry to change policing in America. The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered one of two eulogies during the service Monday, and he had sharp words for those who looted stores and clashed with police after the teenager was shot. \"You do not understand that Michael Brown does not want to be remembered for a riot. He wants to be remembered as the one that made America deal with how we are going to police in the United States.\" With a call to action, Sharpton criticized police who pointed rifles at peaceful protesters in Ferguson. \"We have to leave here today and change this,\" he said. He urged mourners at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church to respect the Brown family's wish for silence Monday. And when protests resume, Sharpton said \"they have asked for it to be peaceful. If you cannot control yourself, then do not do it in Michael's name. Do it in your own name.\" Brown's great-uncle, the Rev. Charles Ewing, drew parallels between the teenager's life, death and Scripture during his eulogy on behalf of the family. \"Michael Brown's blood is crying from the ground, crying for vengeance, crying for justice,\" he said. \"There is a cry being made from the ground, not just for Michael Brown but for the Trayvon Martins, for those children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, for the Columbine massacre, for the black-on-black crime.\" Family members and friends reflecting on their memories of \"Mike Mike\" recalled him saying, \"One day, the world will know my name.\" \"Michael was a big guy, but he was a kind, gentle soul, and before he left this Earth, the day that he was killed, he was out spreading the word of Jesus Christ,\" a family friend said. They urged the crowd of thousands of mourners to \"show up at the voting polls,\" because \"we have had enough to of seeing our brothers and sisters killed in the streets.\" \"If we had more of this,\" one family member said, referring to the audience and then motioning to Brown's casket, \"we could have less of this. It should not have took this to get us together like this.\" A message of hope to a full sanctuary Bishop Edwin Bass of the Church of God in Christ told the Brown family that he, too, lost a child to violence on the streets of St. Louis. \"While this tragic loss will always be with you, the step-by-step, one foot in front of the other march of time will ultimately bring you to a divine place where you will laugh again, you will find the joy of living again, as your thinking shifts from tragedy to the joyful reflection of good times.\" Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, wiped away tears as she stood at the coffin that holds her son's body. She wrote a letter to her son published in the funeral program that said in part, \"I never want this to go unsaid, there are no words to express how much you mean to me. A son like you, I thought could never be. Because the day you were born, I just know, God sent me a blessing and that was you.\" His father, Michael Brown Sr., wrote his own letter, saying, \"I always told you I will never let nothing happen to you. And that is what hurt sooooooo much, that I could not protect you but we love you. I will never let you die in my heart, you will always live forever.\" The sanctuary, which holds 2,500 people, was filled, and an overflow auditorium was also full. It was estimated by reporters at the service that another 2,000 people were on church property for the funeral in addition to those in the sanctuary. Retired mail carrier Hilliard Phillips, who once delivered on the street where Brown was killed, was among the mourners. He said there is power in numbers, and he hoped the outpouring of support for Brown and his family would spur society to take a look at itself. \"You cannot really overnight change the behavior of a person, but sometimes they can be coerced in a sweet way. I would hope they could see people coming together in a solemn way to show their respect to someone,\" he said. Following the service, scores of motorcycles ridden by mourners accompanied the funeral procession that carried Brown's body to St. Peter's Cemetery in St. Louis. T-shirts and buttons memorializing Michael Brown Brown's death on August 9 sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb and concern over race and police shootings across the country. In the past several days, things have calmed down, and the town is slowly coming back to life. Among the guests at the service were Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the families of Trayvon Martin and Sean Bell; and celebrities Spike Lee, Diddy and Snoop Lion. The White House sent three officials to the funeral. One of them was Broderick Johnson, who leads the White House's My Brother's Keeper Task Force. He was joined by Marlon Marshall, a St. Louis native who attended high school with Brown's mother, and Heather Foster. Marshall and Foster are part of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, however, did not attend. \"The governor has communicated to attorneys representing the family of Michael Brown that he will not be attending today's funeral out of respect for the family, who deserve time to focus on remembering Michael and grieving their loss,\" spokesman Scott Holste said before the service. A tense tranquility One sign of a return to normality: Children in the Ferguson-Florissant School District finally started school Monday. The first day had been scheduled for August 18 but was delayed a week because of looting and protests, reported CNN affiliate KMOV. Two weeks after the shooting sparked violent protests, the mood turned more tranquil over the weekend, with smaller crowds and lots of music. Gone were police in riot gear and defiant protesters. The tear gas, rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails were nowhere to be seen, either. In their place were clusters of officers, hanging around businesses, chatting with one another. Race has been at the forefront of the tensions; Brown was African-American, and the officer who shot him is white. Two investigations one federal and one run by state prosecutors are in the early stages of trying to determine what led up to the shooting. Investigators are grappling with witness statements that include shifting and contradictory stories, and some who appear to be reciting accounts of what they have seen in the media, two law enforcement sources told CNN. Complete coverage of Michael Brown's shooting Eliott C. McLaughlin reported from St. Louis, and Michael Pearson and Susanna Capelouto reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez, Aaron Cooper, Faith Karimi and Dana Ford contributed to this report. <doc_sep> ST. LOUIS His gold-and-black coffin was topped by a baseball cap a palpable, personal reminder of the young man who was fatally shot by a police officer only weeks ago. But the calls from the pulpit were for Michael Brown's memory to live on in a broad movement for justice, for voter participation, and for answers to vexing and unending questions about race and policing. \"There is a cry being made from the ground, not just for Michael Brown, but for the Trayvon Martins, for those children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, for the Columbine massacre, for the black-on-black crime,\" the Rev. Charles Ewing, Mr. Brown's uncle, told 2,500 people packed into the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church here on Monday for a funeral attended by family members but also by people Mr. Brown had never met celebrities, representatives from the White House, members of Congress, civil rights leaders and hundreds of residents.

Relatives reminisced in choked voices about Mr. Brown's wide smile as a picture from his high school graduation flashed on two wide screens, as leaders urged those gathered to memorialize Mr. Brown's life by carrying forward a vocal, strong and unified effort to seek change across the country.",
