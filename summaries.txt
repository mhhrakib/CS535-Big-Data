CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand | 
 
 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ruled out running for president in 2012 or 2016 on Friday, saying the United States should be ready for a woman president but it would not be her. 
 
 In interviews in New Zealand, the failed 2008 presidential candidate made clear she had no plans to run again despite talk -- fueled partly by her fellow Democrats' losses in Tuesday's U.S. mid-term elections -- she might embark on a new race. 
 
 Asked by TV3 New Zealand whether she ruled out standing for the top U.S. office through 2016, Clinton, according to a U.S. reporter, replied: "Oh yes, yes. I'm very pleased to be doing what I'm doing as secretary of state." 
 
 In a separate interview with TV New Zealand, Clinton said she hoped the United States was ready for a female president, adding "it should be." 
 
 Asked if it might be her, she replied: "Well, not me. But it will be someone and it is nice coming to countries that...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– A day after being accidentally introduced as "President Clinton," Hillary seems to be taking pains to kill talk of a future run in New Zealand's media, reports Reuters. Asked whether she'd "ruled out" running through 2016, she replied, "Oh yes, yes. I'm very pleased to be doing what I'm doing as secretary of state." Asked in another interview whether she could be the first female president, she answered, "Well, not me. But it will be someone ..." The significance? Probably not much, writes Laura Rozen in Politico, noting how one of Clinton's answers is tied to her being secretary of state—a post she likely won't hold in 2016. On another front, Clinton said the midterm losses were "big—but not out of the pattern of historical political elections." She added, "I think the president made very clear was he made decisions which were essential for the well-being of the American people."

GENERATED SUMMARY:
NEW: Clinton says U.S. should be ready for a female president, adding "it should be" Clinton says she is very pleased to be doing what she is doing as Secretary of State. Clinton also sought to defend President Barack Obama and put the Democrats' losses in the midterms in perspective. New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key introduced her yesterday as "President Clinton"

 While the ocean covers roughly 70 percent of our planet’s surface, we currently only have about 5-7 percent of that spectacularly large area mapped in any meaningful way. In fact, we have better maps of the surface of the moon and mars than we do of the ocean floor. XPRIZE, the non-profit foundation whose lofty mission is to “design and manage public competitions” that better mankind, has just launched a new ocean challenge which will likely draw the attention of marine scientists, geologists and hobbyists everywhere. 
 
 The three-year global competition is focused on ocean mapping and, with a U.S.$ 7,000,000 prize purse and the illustrious title of “XPRIZE Winner”, the competition is is likely to push the technologies that drive ocean exploration. 
 
 “This competition is technically challenging, but it is also very interdisciplinary. It involves underwater robotics, it involves computer science, there is a digital imagery component to it… We expect a number o...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– Have a great idea about how to map the ocean floor? It could be worth millions. The X Prize Foundation, which two years ago asked for a way to gauge ocean acidification, is offering $7 million to teams able to develop high-resolution maps of the seafloor over the next three years. The latest competition meant to better humankind aims to hurry "innovation to further explore one of our greatest unexplored frontiers," X Prize CEO Peter Diamandis tells NBC News, noting "95% of the deep sea remains a mystery to us." In truth, we have better maps of the moon and Mars than of the seafloor, per National Geographic and Live Science. The foundation will accept submissions for robots capable of creating high-resolution maps, identifying geological and archaeological features like volcanoes and shipwrecks, and taking photos until September 2016. The devices will be tested at 6,500 and 13,000 feet about a year later. "This competition is technically challenging, but it is also very interdisciplinary," says X Prize's senior director. "It involves underwater robotics, it involves computer science, there is a digital imagery component to it. We want to help spur unparalleled ocean exploration through innovation and radical breakthroughs to find all the different wonders in the deep sea." The team that claims the top prize will take home $4 million, the second-place team will get $1 million, and an additional $1 million will be divided among other teams in the top 10. There will also be a $1 million award funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for any device that can follow a chemical or biological signal to detect "sources of pollution, enable rapid response to leaks and spills, identify hydrothermal vents and methane seeps, as well as track marine life for scientific research and conservation efforts," per an NOAA scientist.

The former Army captain who received the Medal of Honor on Tuesday has asked to return to active duty in the Army, a rare move by an officer who has lived to wear the military's highest award. 
 
 Two U.S. officials tell The Associated Press that William D. Swenson has submitted a formal request to the Army and officials are working with him to allow his return. 
 
 Swenson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in the White House Tuesday afternoon for risking his life to recover bodies and save fellow troops during a lengthy battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan near the Pakistan border in 2009. 
 
 The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the request until a decision was made. 
 
 Swenson, 34, left the military in February 2011 as a captain, but he could rise to the rank of major once he rejoins. In order to successfully re-enlist, Swenson will have to pass a physical, a drug test and other routine reviews. B...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– Former Army Capt. Will Swenson received the nation's highest military honor today for rescuing fellow soldiers under heavy fire in Afghanistan a few years ago, reports CNN. And in a rare move, the 34-year-old has formally asked the Army to return him to active duty, reports AP. Generally speaking, Medal of Honor recipients are out of action, but it looks like Swenson will be back in uniform fairly soon. Swenson left the military in 2011, two years after the actions during a firefight in Afghanistan's Ganjgal valley that earned him his medal. "In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best," said President Obama at today's ceremony, as quoted by Fox News.

Army Capt. William Swenson has asked to return to active duty, officials say. Swenson was awarded the Medal of Honor on Tuesday for his actions in Afghanistan. Swenson, 34, left the military in February 2011 as a captain, but could rise to the rank of major.

 Just minutes after Soundgarden’s concert at the Fox Theatre ended Wednesday night, frontman Chris Cornell was back in his hotel room at the MGM Grand, talking by phone with his wife. 
 
 What Vicky Cornell heard alarmed her. 
 
 Her husband was slurring his words, sounded groggy and kept repeating: “I’m just tired,” according to a family statement and a police report obtained by The Detroit News. 
 
 She asked the band’s bodyguard to check on Cornell, who busted into the room and made a gruesome discovery: the alternative rocker was on the bathroom floor “with blood running from his mouth and a red exercise band around (his) neck,” according to the report. 
 
 Within two hours, Cornell, 52, was pronounced dead. The police report, filed by officers from the Detroit Poli...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– Chris Cornell kept saying "I'm just tired" in his final phone conversation with his wife, according to a police report with more details on the final hour of the Soundgarden frontman's life. Vicky Cornell, alarmed by how different her husband sounded, called band bodyguard Martin Kirsten, who had to kick in two latched doors before he found the 52-year-old dead on the bathroom floor with "blood running from his mouth and a red exercise band" around his neck, according to a police report seen by the Detroit News. His death was ruled suicide by hanging, but Vicky Cornell says he told her he "had taken an extra Ativan" or two, and she believes the anti-anxiety medication or other substances may have clouded his judgment. According to TMZ, Cornell used a piece of climbing equipment to secure the exercise band to the bathroom door at his suite in the MGM Grand Hotel in Detroit. Less than an hour earlier, the band had played a sold-out show in front of 5,000 fans. Soundgarden had been scheduled to play the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio Friday night, Pitchfork reports. Instead, artists including Bush and Live paid tribute to Cornell by covering songs by his bands Soundgarden, Audioslave, and Temple of the Dog. Rolling Stone reports that Rage Against the Machine co-founder Tom Morello paid tribute to his former Audioslave bandmate with a moving poem, which can be seen in full here.

GENERATED SUMMARY:
Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit. He was on the bathroom floor "with blood running from his mouth and a red exercise band around (his) neck," a police report says. Within two hours, Cornell, 52, was pronounced dead.

There are others who believe he should get a special Nobel just for being Bob Dylan 
 
 In the latest of many distinctions garlanding a career stretching back five-and-a-half decades, Bob Dylan has become the first member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to win the Nobel prize in literature. Some will argue against the awa...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– "Bob Dylan" was one of the top Twitter trends Thursday thanks to the troubadour taking home the Nobel Prize for Literature. But while most of social media is beaming at his newest honor, Scottish author Irvine Welsh, who wrote the novel Trainspotting, isn't terribly pleased, the AP reports. Welsh spent much of Thursday morning on Twitter retweeting posts that trashed Dylan's win, and tweeting: "I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies." His main beef appears to be the separation of a metaphorical church and state—in this case, songs and lit—that he thinks should exist, adding, "If you're a 'music' fan, look it up in the dictionary. Then 'literature'. Then compare and contrast." Other takes on Dylan's new laureate status: The Wall Street Journal lists feedback from major authors, from the gushing—Salman Rushdie writes on Twitter, "From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice"—to the eyerolling, including satirical writer Gary Shteyngart's take: "I totally get the Nobel committee. Reading books is hard." Jay Perini gives a thumbs-up at CNN, noting how Dylan's songs "speak to our deepest concerns" and how he's "filled our heads with language that both interprets and transforms the realities we confront." At the Guardian, Richard Williams looks at whether music and literature can actually be successfully linked (in terms of a Nobel Prize), and he breaks it down line by line to show the "profound resonance" of Dylan's lyrics. Robert Chalmers makes the slightly uncomfortable observation for GQ that "everything would be so much more simple if he were dead," as Dylan would have ascended to legendary status. But Chalmers still jumps on the pro-Dylan bandwagon, noting, "His voice may, like the Havana cigars and bourbon to which it is often lazily compared, be an acquired taste, but Dylan is responsible, as much as Billie Holiday, for reinventing the whole style of popular singing." Meanwhile, a naysayer singing the Black "Eating Crow" Blues: Alex Shephard, who wrote last week for the New Republic that "Bob Dylan 100 percent is not going to win. Stop saying Bob Dylan should win the Nobel Prize."

GENERATED SUMMARY:
Bob Dylan is the first member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to win the Nobel prize in literature. Some will argue against the award, as they argued against him in the long and infinitely tiresome Dylan v Keats controversy. Others will feel that he deserves the creation of a special Nobel prize simply for being Bob Dylan.
