Most of the Secret Service agents embroiled in a prostitution scandal brought women back to their Colombia hotel rooms before President Obama arrived in town for an international summit, Rep. Pete King said Saturday.     King said the raunchy rendezvous involved 11 agents and went sour when an agent refused to pay one of the women, who were presumed to be hookers.     “The agent said, ‘I don't owe you anything,’ but gave the woman some money,” said King (R-L.I.),the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, who was briefed on the matter. “I don't know how much, and it was settled right there.”     IN COLOMBIA, THE SEX BUSINESS IS SO BIG THAT SOME CALL IT THE 'THAILAND OF LATIN AMERICA'     As it turned out, the agents’ troubles were just beginning. Local cops were called to the hotel in Cartagena and, because the matter involved foreigners, a report was written up and sent to the U.S. Embassy, King said.     Embassy officials in turn notified the Secret Service, which immediately ...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– The Secret Service prostitution scandal that's threatening to overshadow the Summit of the Americas came to light after one agent refused to pay one of the women involved, reports the New York Daily News. “The agent said, ‘I don't owe you anything,’ but gave the woman some money,” says Rep. Peter King, who as head of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been briefed. The agents, part of an advance team that was supposed to secure President Obama's hotel, were caught with prostitutes in their hotel rooms, and the dispute caused a disturbance that got local police involved. “Number one, it is against basic ethics to go to a prostitute. Number two, it is incredibly embarrassing to the White House,” says one insider, who added that the agents' careers are probably over. “Yes, doubly good judgment there.” Eleven agents have been placed on leave in the incident, notes the AP, and another five military personnel have been accused of similar misconduct after violating curfew. None of the Secret Service agents involved were directly responsible for Obama's protection. A Secret Service rep has apologized "for any distraction."

GENERATED SUMMARY:
The 11 Secret Service agents were part of an advance team assigned to secure a local hotel before the summit began, yet their attention apparently turned to taking advantage of Colombia's policy of legal prostitution. Five American service members were also accused of misconduct stemming from the scandalous incident at the hotel, according to the YOU.S. They had arranged to have a bunch of prostitutes come by and one of the agents refused to pay a prostitute, said author Ronald Kessler, who was briefed on the investigation by his sources within the agency, told the Daily News Saturday that the spurned hooker told police about the lack of payment. Kessler said he was not sure exactly how many women were involved, but he did not know how much, and it was settled right there. The agent said, 'I do not owe you anything,' but gave the woman some money, says Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.), the chairman of a House Homeland Security Committee panel that has been briefed by a senior agency official.

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– A sad day for the Ben Carson campaign: The GOP candidate canceled Tuesday and Wednesday campaign events after the death of a volunteer in a car crash in western Iowa. Braden Joplin, a 25-year-old from Midland, Texas, was fatally injured and three other campaign workers were hurt Tuesday afternoon when their van flipped over on an icy road and was hit by another vehicle, reports NBC News. Joplin was flown to a hospital in Nebraska, while the other three were treated locally and released. Politico reports that Carson, who was in South Carolina at the time, flew to Nebraska when he heard the news and paid for a private jet to bring Joplin's family out from Texas. "One of the precious few joys of campaigning is the privilege of meeting bright young men and women who are so enthusiastic about their country that they will freely give of their time and energy to work on its behalf," Carson said in a statement. "America lost one of those bright young men today. I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing." Other candidates, including Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton, tweeted their condolences, while Bernie Sanders mentioned Joplin at the start of a rally in Iowa City, the AP reports. "I have a lot of respect for any young person who gets involved in the political process," Sanders said. "Our hearts go out to the family of the young man."

Carson was campaigning Tuesday in South Carolina when he got the news and canceled the rest of his schedule on the day, as well as a scheduled event Wednesday in California. A spokesman for Carson said the retired neurosurgeon would return to Iowa on Thursday, where the critical Republican caucuses are scheduled for February 1.

Perhaps Google (Alphabet?) should have googled its new name before it decided to restructure the whole company.     The New York Times reports that Google's new parent company, Alphabet, has encountered an issue with german automaker BMW, which owns a fleet services company with the same name and the domain Alphabet.com.     A spokesperson for BMW told the Times the company isn't planning on selling its domain and that Alphabet was a large part of its business.     See also: What Google has to gain by adopting the Alphabet     With the major restructuring announcement yesterday, Alphabet launched abc.xyz as its domain name. Alphabet, led by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is now the parent company of Google, a move designed to separate the core products (search, Gmail, Android, etc.) from its more far reaching projects (Fiber, Calico, X, self-driving cars).     While the move makes sense for Alphabet, it confused many.     BMW is looking into whether Google's Alphabet has i...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
– Guess Google execs are serious about that whole reorg under the Alphabet parent-company thing. Just days after Alphabet officially became Google's holding company, it scooped up a brand-new domain name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, which has been around since 1999 and was purchased for an unspecified amount, NBC News reports. The page isn't functional as of this post, and a company rep says, "We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we're just being thorough." (Google set up that website in August.) It's hard to imagine Google directing the general public to use the site—would you want to type in all those letters every time?—and NBC notes the domain purchase may simply be a preemptive strike to keep others from usurping it for their own use. Two domains the company probably won't be able to get its hands on: ABC.com (for the American Broadcasting Company, owned by Disney) and alphabet.com, which BMW is unlikely to give up, notes Consumerist. If you'd been hoping to nab the domain for yourself, you can always try to cybersquat the site away when Google's hold on it expires in August 2018. (Alphabet has ditched its "Don't Be Evil" motto for one that's not as quirky.)

A spokesperson for BMW told the Times the company is not planning on selling its domain and that Alphabet was a large part of its business. Alphabet, led by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is now the parent company of Google, a move designed to separate the core products (search, Gmail, Android, etc.) from its more far reaching projects (Fiber, Calico, X, self-driving cars). BMW is looking into whether Google's Alphabet has infringed on its trademark, with no legal action currently planned. The New York Times reports that Google has encountered an issue with german automaker BMW, which owns a fleet services company with the same name and the domain Alphabet.com. Google founder Sergey Page said Alphabet would not be introducing products under its own name, so it wouldn't be a public facing name like Google. We do not intend to become a conventional company, and we will continue to do what we have been doing for the last 11 years.
